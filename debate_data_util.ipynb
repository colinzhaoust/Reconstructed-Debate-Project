The 2nd amendment was written back when all these deadly weapons didn't exist and therefore weren't even used for wars. The 2nd amendment was written because when America was created, they thought the country possibly won't exist for even 10 years. Thus, they created the 2nd amendment so people can be prepared for battle if a group of people try to violently wipe of the existence of America off the Earth. Nowadays, America is an extremely powerful country with 4,000 nuclear bombs and a powerful military. Do we really need to worry about someone getting rid of America? The 2nd amendment was written for that time and doesn't apply to the modern world. This is just like how some stuff in the Bible or Quran were written only for the time they were written and don't apply to the modern world.We cannot blindly follow the constitution.

If someone does a massacre/explosion/etc. And they are motivated by religion, then they aren't a terrorist at all. They're a militant religious extremist. The established definition of terrorism is someone who does violence, murder, or destruction, especially against civilians, for a political aim.

You don't redefine a word to be politically correct. Is they have all the stuff a straight married couple has, then why is that homosexual people want the marriage label to describe their union so bad? As long as you have everything straight married couples have, isn't that all that matters? That's the only reason you wanted to marry. Why does a certain word have to describe your union. Same-sex unions were never part of the established definition of marriage. And the definition of marriage has existed for a long time. I know polygamy and stuff like that is part of the established definition of marriage but polygamy is a bad thing. Same-sex couples having the benefits/etc. Of straight married couples is completely ok. But it isn't true marriage. That's why i believe same-sex couples should have the benefits/etc. Of straight marriages but the same-sex union shouldn't be called marriage. How is it logical that we can redefine marriage but redefining words like male/gender/female should be resisted no matter what? You might say that definitions of words change when it comes to redefining marriage, but i could use that same logic for redefining male/gender/female. We can redefine marriage but we must resist redefining male/gender/female no matter what? How is that logical? That's a contradiction. Same-sex marriage is fake marriage. Facts are facts and facts don't care about your feelings. Your feelings don't affect the definitions of words. Who has said that if you refuse to deny facts to be politically correct then that is wrong? Who has said that? I have to deny the fact that same-sex marriage isn't marriage otherwise i'm a bigot? I cannot accept facts? I have to deny facts to be politically correct and avoid offending people? And people wonder why some people try to redefine male/gender/female. And people wonder why some people believe there are more than 2 genders or believe that some males have vaginas or some females have penises. And interracial marriage is marriage because the established definition of marriage never said that marriage is between people of the same race. Interracial marriage was banned because the government didn't want whites to marry blacks. It had nothing to do with what marriage truly is.

If there is anything my opponent disagrees with in the syllogism he should address it before accepting, and I will amend it.   Round 1 is for acceptance. 3000 character limit. 3 days per round. ', 'Thank you for accepting         Equivocation    In order to address the 3rd premise, we need to establish the meaning of objective ethics and objective justification. Objective ethics is a methodology for what ought or ought not to occur, irrespective of what does occur or what any individual would prefer to occur (1). It is an unconditional demand. Objective justification is a theory’s or action’s accordance with logic. The difference here lies in the basis of both terms. Objective justification is rooted in logic whereas objective morality is based on nothing except its own inherent truth.     We see this in all normative claims. They appeal to either supposedly naturally occurring knowledge, or some transcendent meta-ethical fact, such as in Kant’s categorical imperative.     In short, logically justified =/= morally justified. In its nature, morality supersedes logic. So therefore all the syllogism proves is that illogical actions are illogical.  It does not actually demonstrate why one “ought not act illogically.”             \"Is not\" justified vs. \"cannot\" be justified       In this argument I will assume that “logically unjustified” does equal “objectively morally unjustified”…and prove that there is still a problem with the theory.     Discourse Ethics passively suggests that all actions are unethical until they are justified - because an action that has yet to be verbally justified is technically   unjustified   as per premise 3. My opponent will likely respond by saying that it is   unjustifiable   actions (actions that cannot ever be logically justified even if we tried) that matter. However, that wouldn’t be a valid response. This is why:    Suppose that the sun has the ability to explode in the solar system at any moment…but by the end of time, it never exploded. Relative to the solar system, what is the significance of that ability if it never occurred? Nothing.    Morality is judged from an external perspective…a 3  rd   person view of the action and the agent (much like the solar system is to a star). If it was judged in any other way, it would be subjective. Therefore, from such a view, an action’s ability to be justified is irrelevant. All that matters is whether or not it   is   justified. Therefore, even the actions that   can   be justified but   weren’t  , are immoral according to Discourse Ethics.    Conclusion:   Something cannot be immoral until proven moral. That would suggest that some actions were previously immoral and then became moral,…which is inconsistent. Objective morality, by nature, never changes.       Source  1.   http://en.wikipedia.org... ', 'Equivocation    What my opponent is describing is not objective morality. There are 2 ways an action can be justified, logically and morally. Neither form exists within or necessitates the other. When we argue using discourse, logic is the universal and objective litmus test on the validity of a proposition. However, the nature of objective morality is that it reaches   equal   height of logic and becomes its   own   separate type of objective communicator. So in some arguments, instead of submitting to logic, the arguer can submit to the objective moral law. Logic is not dependent on morality and morality is not dependent on logic. They are both separate and individual justification systems. My opponent may find such a system to be ridiculous, but that’s simply one more reason to be a nihilist,... this is in fact the nature of objective ethics. The following quote sort of demonstrates what I mean:    “  Humans do not invent numbers, and humans cannot alter them. Plato explained the eternal character of mathematics by stating that they are     abstract entities     that exist in a spirit-like realm. He noted that moral values   also   are absolute truths and thus are   also   abstract, spirit-like entities  ”(1)    “Also” implies equality in the mentioned characteristics. Morality and Logic are conceptual colleagues operating on a lateral playing field..neither encompasses the other.   Objective morality invented within logic,…is not actually objective morality. It is objective logic. All Discourse ethics proves is that illogical actions are illogical. No morality there.     I will concede the   isn’t-cannot   argument and forward this instead:             Logic knows no “ought”    Rationality demands that you must have a reason for doing an action,…and that your action is in accordance with your reasons (else the action is irrational). The statement: “one ought to do X. Period.” Is a means with no end…and an action that must simply be done without any reason. For example, one does not need a reason to not steal,…he simply “ought not steal”. So, objective morality is not just separate from logic but inherently defiant of logic.       This is a logical statement    If you don’t want to contradict yourself, then you ought not argue for an irrational action      This is an objective moral statement    You ought not argue for an irrational action.         My opponent cannot choose the 1  st   statement because it is conditional…the “ought” is only true so long as the “if” is true. So that is not objective. My opponent has no choice but to assume the 2  nd   statement, in which case he contradicts himself. An obligation cannot be unconditional yet rational. This is a very ironic situation we have. It appears that my opponent presupposes rationality (through the act of arguing)…while advocating an irrational obligation. I believe the conclusion here is obvious. Discourse ethics is inherently contradictory and destroys itself.       Source    1.   http://www.iep.utm.edu... ', 'Equivocation    My opponent completely mischaracterizes my argument. I am not simply summarizing a position, I am proving it. When I referenced Plato, that wasn’t an appeal to authority, it was a piece of evidence to corroborate the claim. That was a definition of what objective morality   has   to be in order to be objective. Perhaps I should make the reasoning clearer.    Let us take Kant’s Categorical Imperative for instance. This is a form of objective morality because it is an unconditional obligation. However, the CI does not appeal to logic or operate under logic. In fact, I consider the CI outright illogical. However that is irrelevant because it appeals to some other transcendent order, not logic:    “[Justifying the Categorical Imperative]   This proves, said Kant, that man’s concepts are only a delusion, but a collective delusion which no one has the power to escape. Thus   reason   and science are “limited,” said Kant; they are valid only so long as they deal with this world, with a permanent, pre-determined collective delusion (and thus the criterion of reason’s validity was switched from the objective to the collective  )”(1)    Morality born within logic is still just logic. Just because justifying an irrational action forms a contradiction, does not mean that we “ought not to contradict ourselves.” My opponent never bridges the is-ought gap…simply because it cannot be bridged. Logic is a kind of order based on what   is  . Morality is a completely separate order based on what   ought   to be. If you find that an action is illogical, it does not necessarily follow that we “ought not to act illogically.” That is why objective morality cannot exist within logical parameters.         Logic knows no ought    My opponent states that rationality is necessary in ethics - this begs the question. He’s using as his premise, what we’re supposed to be debating. Rationality is not necessary in objective ethics because morality is its own separate order. Furthermore, he pretty much evades my point on “reasons” so I will reiterate it.    P1. All rational actions need reasons    P2. Objective ethical obligations are reason-less actions    C1. Objective ethical obligations are irrational    C2. Objective ethics cannot exist within logic    The ambiguity is in perhaps the second premise. However, the second premise is still correct. Objective ethics is true regardless of any individual’s desire. One need not form a reason, or ponder over the action, he must simply do it. It therefore follows that objective ethics cannot be logical.                      Conclusion    Discourse ethics is a verbose failure that hides fallacy within complexity. It first of all falls under the fallacy of equivocation by manipulating the vagueness between logical justification and moral justification. Then it fails to justify how “is illogical” becomes “ought not to be illogical”. It has no sound foundation beyond confusion in the use of language. Therefore, I hope the negative case is clear.

I am completely honored and grateful to debate popculturepooka on this subject, and look forward to an extremely challenging debate. ', \"I thank my opponent once more for accepting and will try my best to make a convincing argument against the resolution. The video to the right will be referred to later on in this argument.        Determinism       The definition of freewill that this debate refers to automatically assumes Incompatibilism. If freewill is the ability to choose without constraint, then determined actions exclude freewill. Predetermined action is in and of itself the ultimate constraint on the free choice, for what can be free if all actions are inevitable?    To prove that human beings have no freewill, I therefore offer the argument for Incompatibilist Determinism -   a   philosophy stating that for everything that happens there are conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen.   (1)            The Argument from Physics    The law of conservation of energy postulates a fixed quantity of energy in the entire universe, where energy can neither be created nor destroyed – only converted to varying forms. This suggests that any motion of the body is solely caused by and subject to prior physical factors. Thus, the only way for a non-physical factor such as “the will” to force a body movement would be for it to   create   energy…an obvious impossibility. If my opponent denies that “the will” would need to create energy, then he suggests that a non-physical factor can affect already existing physical things….which too is an obvious impossibility.     “  If a state of will, which is mental, caused an act of the body, which is physical, by so much would the physical energy of the world be increased, which is contrary to the hypothesis universally adopted by physicists. Hence, to physics, the will of man is not a     vera cama     in explaining physical movement  ”(2)      The Law of Causation    No action is uncaused, and we live life and inquire explanations for observations under this assumption. Human action is a physical event; hence it must be created through an antecedent physical cause. Freewill is not real or physical, yet we bestow upon it the power to cause physical action. This is contrary to the nature of the Universe and has little to no scientific basis. It is a tradition in human history to explain phenomena with simple animistic assertions (ie. The thunderstorms once caused by Zeus, and the rain by rain Gods). Thus, to say that the will may control the body is similar to arguing that we may levitate rocks through mind control. Something unreal and non-physical has no bearing on physical things.     “  Now human action is, of course, a physical effect; hence, we must expect to find only a physical cause; hence, any non-physical, psychical cause is from the nature of the case precluded, hence, of course the human will effects nothing.  ”   (2)       The “Dilemma of Determinism” Argument       P1: Either determinism is true or it is false    P2: If determinism is true, then all actions are inevitable, thus freewill does not exist    P3: If determinism is false, then all actions are random, thus freewill does not exist    C: It is impossible for freewill to exist       Premise 1   invokes the law of excluded middle, which should make it logically valid. I don’t think it needs much explanation.       Premise 2   can be justified by Peter Van Inwagen’s “Consequence Argument.” It asserts that if we have no choice as to whether the laws regarding the universe are true, and all those laws dictate determined actions, then we have no choice as to the occurrence of those actions. (3) Having no choice as to the occurrence of one’s own actions is the negation of freewill.       Premise 3   can also be justified using Inwagen’s “Mind Argument.” He states that “  an act that occurs by chance, if an event that occurs by chance can be called an act, cannot be under the control of its alleged agent and hence cannot have been performed freely  .”(4) We can form this premise knowing that either actions are random, or they are caused. Where an action has no cause, it must be random. If my opponent objects, he should name an example where this is not the case.    Given these three premises, it follows that freewill cannot exist.       Libet’s Delay       This study involved a series of conscious patients and their reactions to varying electrical stimulation, or the interval between when the stimulus was given and when the patients were consciously aware of it.     It was found that when the stimulus was given, brain activity called “evoked potential” (EP) ensued tens of milliseconds afterward. The EP had to persist for 500 milliseconds before the subject became aware of it. However, half of a second was too large and noticeable of a period of time. The study would have suggested that it takes .5 seconds for human beings to respond to everything. This would contradict our own perceptions, since we believe that we react to numerous things far quicker than half one second.    It followed that humans act before they are conscious that they have acted, and when the action reaches consciousness, our brains fabricate the retroactive illusion that we were conscious of the event at the moment the event occurred.       The conclusion was thus: “  the perceived time at which we make a decision must be subjectively referred back by 500 milliseconds. Unlikely as it seems, and contrary to our own impression, we must have made our decisions slightly before we actually become aware of them.”  (5)     which leads to the necessary conclusion for this debate - If we make our decisions before being aware of making them, then our decisions are predetermined. As predetermined action is the most powerful constraint on freedom, humans must not have freewill.             fMRI Testing        Twelve right-handed subjects (aged 22-29) were tested using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the University of Leipzig. They were placed in front of a screen, showing a descending cascade of letters. They were then to press either a button to the right or to the left at random, then report what letter was on the screen at the moment of their decision.     This was the conclusion:     “  In summary, we could replicate the finding of Soon et al.     [30]     that motor intentions were encoded in frontopolar cortex up to seven seconds before participants were aware of their decisions. Using ultra-high field fMRI on a 7 Tesla scanner, we could show that these patterns became more stable with increasing temporal proximity to the conscious decision. These findings support the conclusion that frontopolar cortex is part of a network of brain regions that shape conscious decisions long before they reach conscious awareness  .”(6)    Strengthening Libet’s observation, it is found that the decision to act occurs before we   think   we are making the decision to act – further undermining the causally direct spontaneity of the will.    “     Another lab recently used fMRI data to show that some “conscious” decisions can be predicted up to 10 seconds before they enter awareness (long before the preparatory motor activity detected by Libet). Clearly, findings of this kind are difficult to reconcile with the sense that one is the conscious source of one’s actions.”  (7)    The video above illustrates the procedure and conclusions from a very similar fMRI test:   Conclusion  Given these arguments, it is evident that the existence of freewill in humanity is highly improbable, if not impossible. My opponent must not only defeat all of those arguments to fulfill his portion of the burden, but prove the existence of freewill as well since he has the affirmative case.   Without further ado, I await my opponent's response.

I extend my Round 2 arguments. ', 'I thank my opponent for his response.    The Argument from the law of Conservation of Energy     I concede this point and retract the argument, since it is rather insignificant to the crux of the negative case.          The Law of Causation       Physicality:        Of or relating to matter and energy or the sciences dealing with them, especially physics.  (1)    My opponent mixes   physicality   and   existence  . Something can exist while being non-physical (ie. thoughts, dreams). I simply argue that a non-physical thing cannot affect physical things such as the brain and body. Of course my opponent is free to dispute the premise and argue that the will is a physical thing. However, he’d have to demonstrate what the will is. Is it matter? Is it energy?    On the premise that freewill is non-physical, it lacks the ability to cause physical things. In this way, I don’t believe the argument begs the question, so I sustain it.    “  Upon this basis the argument for determinism proceeds as follows: Like effects have like causes, the effect is like the cause, the effect is in fact the cause transformed, as the lightning is the effect of the preceding electrical conditions. Now human action is, of course, a physical effect; hence, we must expect to find only a physical cause; hence, any non-physical, psychical cause is from the nature of the case precluded  ”(2)             The Arguments from Neuroscience     Objection 1    “  If interpreted as urges or intentions, for example, then the subject still has time to \"veto\" this urge or intention or decide to act on it.  ”     Libet’s concept of “free won’t” or the conscious veto was nothing more than a last minute reconciliation with moral responsibility. It can be rebuked in the same fashion as “freewill” itself. Of course people have the ability to resist action. However, what prevents this resistance from being subject to the determinist system as well? Whether or not one vetoes will be due to antecedent neuronal causes.     Sam Harris writes:    “  I think Libet’s reasoning was clearly flawed, as there is every reason to think that a conscious veto must also arise on the basis of unconscious neural events  .”(3)    Objection 2    “  For all we know these brain events are correlated with the urges, intentions and considerings - not the decision to itself  ”    This objection may be troublesome in the archaic and limited technology of Libet’s time, but modern neural testing and fMRI disarms this doubt. As part of a surgical procedure conducted by surgeon and neurologist, Itzhak Fried, electrodes were implanted deep in the brains of the patients to precisely monitor their neuronal activity before pressing a button. It was found that their decisions could be predicted with 80% accuracy 700 milliseconds prior to the patient being aware that he had made a decision. (4)     Another experiment conducted by neuroscientist,   John-Dylan Haynes in 2008 modernized Libet’s experiment using fMRI. However, “  critics still picked holes, pointing out that Haynes and his team could predict a left or right button press with only 60% accuracy  ….” (4)     In both cases, the accuracy exceeded 50%, which as of now proves a strong correlative, if not causative relationship between the brain activity and the decision. The activity is not mere urge, intention, and considering, otherwise the predictability would be much lower. Freewill, being uninfluenced, being its own cause, its own origination, has an element of spontaneity. Decisions should not be predicted anywhere near this accurately if a will is truly free.     My opponent may argue that choosing between a left and right button naturally lends 50% accuracy even through pure guesswork. However that would not retract or diminish these experiments given that the scientists saw numbers like 60 and 80!             Argument from Rational Deliberation       “  When we are reasoning about anything we often think that we have several options to choose from wherein in which, in some sense, we could choose to do each one if we thought we had good reason to do so  ”    The central tenant and preponderant point hammered by every determinist in the world is the notion that we cannot trust our senses. The implication of every test from Libet’s delay to the various fMRIs is the presence of a neuronal illusion – whether it means that our consciousness is referred back 500 milliseconds in time, or that antecedent brain activity predicts decision before decision is made.     Yet, the Argument from Rational Deliberation relies solely upon common human perception – the very faculty in question. So, I find the conclusions derived from it, in a way, irrelevant.     I also contest that determinism does not deny rational deliberation. It merely states that the outcome of that deliberation is inevitable whether the inevitability is recognized or not. Given that determinists, again, argue that we operate under an illusion, it is no wonder that we feel we are actually deliberating something with an undetermined outcome. My opponent attempts to use the consequences of a truth to destroy its validity – kind of like arguing that       Conclusion       Freewill is more contradictory to nature, science, and logic than it would appear. Things do not simply happen, they happen because a preceding force caused them to happen.  A will therefore cannot act in a vacuum. It must have preceding cause; and every advancement in science and neurology corroborates this fact with increasing certainty. You also have the fact that a will has no place or fit in the universe, for actions are caused or they are random, both cases excluding the notion of a free will. Freewill stands among the ranks of the thunder gods and the rain spirits, the fire demons and the fairies – animistic assertions for phenomena that cannot yet be explained. From this mounting evidence, it follows that freewill simply cannot exist.     I once again thank my opponent for the debate opportunity and the challenging responses.

Premise 2:   As defined in Round 1, God is the divine author of all things and creator of the universe. Therefore, logic must be his invention. And by virtue of his omnipotence, he is not bound by it. Given that the definition of God was permanently established in Round 1, the only possible point of contention my opponent has is to attack the notion that God is not bound by logic. However, if God is in fact bound by logic, then he is not all-powerful. If logic is not God’s creation, then he is not the divine author of everything.       In short, in order for God to be God he must be capable of modifying or bypassing logic whenever he so pleases….and insofar as he has those powers, he must be logically impossible. ', 'Thanks for the response Thett       Premise 1: Defense          The “logically” in “logically possible” is not a superfluous adjective. “Logically” is deliberately inserted both in the resolution and my syllogism to draw a distinction between that which is logically possible (as in, permitted by logic), and that which is just possible. There are events that occur (particularly on the Quantum Scale, as my opponent mentioned) that directly defy classical logic.   So really what I am affirming is that God is inconsistent with classical logic (hence logically impossible)….not that God is simply impossible.   This was not intended to be a surprise trick or anything. I thought it was understood. In this way, Premise 1 is indeed self-evident. If it is logically possible, it abides by the rules of logic.    I disagree with my opponent when he says that we can imagine illogical things. What we can imagine are stupid/irrational scenarios, like a 1 million year old clown being president of Hong Kong, not illogical ones. To prove my point, try imaging a square that is triangular. However, this is a moot point, even if we could imagine such things, imagining something that is illogical is not itself illogical. What is contradictory about imagining something that is contradictory? The nature of the abstraction you imagined is illogical, not the act of imagining it.    I completely agree with my opponent on the non-universality of logic, but I never claimed that was universal. Again “logically” is a very distinctive adjective in this debate. However, before anyone breathes a sigh of relief that this argument is not really attacking the standard God, I’ll explain what damage it does at the end.            Premise 2:  God is not bound by logic (Defense)       “  Ike gives you no reason to think that God is forced to follow the rules in the Universe he created rather than just choosing to do so. For example, if I impose a rule upon myself, I am the creator of the rule, but I can break it if I wish.  ”    This doesn’t really address the premise. If God “chooses” to follow the rules of logic, then he is not bound by logic. Logic demands a COMPULSORY adherence to its rules, not voluntary. A voluntary adherence to logic is itself in violation of logic.     My opponent offers an extremely innovative rebuttal in saying that logic conforms and changes according to God’s actions, that God IS logic. This took me aback, but unfortunately it fails on its own terms.  If logic may change at any arbitrary moment, then no logical proposition has certainty. And since the law of noncontradiction can also be compromised, we wouldn’t know whether or not logic was still true or false and we wouldn’t know if God had just changed it. Ergo, changeable logic is a pure absurdity that destroys the very argument from which it was born.     Our perception of logic   IS   what we call classical logic. If God is not in line with this perception, which I think my opponent just conceded, then the resolution is affirmed.     “  My opponent posits that if God cant do illogical things than he must not be omnipotent, but     try     to imagine an illogical thing. A circular square is meaningless, it cannt be concieved. How exactly is it a limit on Gods power to not create an abstract object that has no concievable meaning?  ”    My opponent affixes our own limited capabilities to God himself! Is what is meaningless to us also meaningless to him? Does that not mean our intellect and his are equals? Is what is impossible to us also impossible to him? Does that not mean our power and his are equals? What is omnipotence if not boundless power? How can a god be all powerful, yet bounded by logic? The errancy in this argument is evident. It’s a definitional contradiction.            Conclusion     My opponent has unmistakably affirmed the existence of a transcendent, non-logically bound, eternal God,…but not the God the resolution sought to impugn, nor the God of any standard western religions. If an omnipotent God is not bound by logic, which I believe I have proved, then he cannot be affirmed nor negated. He cannot be conceived by our limited minds. The God so many of us believe in, by virtue of his boundless power, has no business in intellectual discourse. There can be no reason to believe in God, for God is above all reason! And within that framework, he is logically impossible.  Resolution affirmed. ', 'I welcome my opponent to DDO, and wish him good luck.

In order to demonstrate the truth of the affirmative case, I will present 2 moral hypotheticals:    1. Lying is wrong.    2. According to Obama, Lying is wrong.     1) Our duty as skeptics is to investigate the   truth   of both propositions. Is it true that lying is wrong? Is it true that Obama says that lying is wrong?  The subject to whom the statement applies must be established in the statement itself, for we are judging the truth of that ethical statement   in and of itself  . A statement like “lying is wrong” neglects to mention to whom lying may be wrong, so is therefore an unrestricted objective claim….which, as previously mentioned, would continue   ad infinitum   in a search for reasons and warrant (why is lying wrong? Because it’s unfair to others. Why is it wrong to be unfair? Because you would not will that others be unfair to you. Why does it matter that I would not will that? Because it means you’re being inconsistent. Why is it wrong to be inconsistent? ……..et cetera, continuing indefinitely). This much, my opponent and I agree on. Objective ethical statements lead to infinity when attempting to justify them. Where we depart, as is the subject of this exchange, is whether or not the same problem will occur under a subjective ethical claim that is subjective in and of itself.    2) The statement “according to Obama, Lying is wrong” is subjective in and of itself. It has a restriction on to whom the claim applies, where the lack thereof would purport unbounded applicability, or objectivity. So, we must ask ourselves is it possible to prove it true that Obama says that lying is wrong? Of course it is. The way to concretely prove that Obama says that lying is wrong is for him to literally admit that he believes that lying is wrong. The fundamental difference between the objective and subjective statement is that in order to prove the truth of the objective statement, you must find why an action OUGHT or OUGHT NOT to occur….whereas all the subjective statement demands is that you demonstrate that the statement is factually correct. For this reason, the objective statement will NEVER be warranted, because the reasons will lead you to infinity, a meaningless continuum. The truth of the subjective statement on the other hand is not concerned with whether lying ought to be wrong,…but that the individual in question does believe that lying is wrong.    For this reason, there is no infinite regress in subjective morality. ', 'I appreciate my opponent’s responses, but must point out where he is mistaken in his reasoning.        I must fulfill 2 burdens in order to win this argument:    1. All I need to prove is that obama thinks that lying is wrong….I do not have to prove that his belief is actually a reasonable one.    2. It is possible to definitively prove that Obama thinks that lying is wrong.            Burden 1    Moral relativism, in the form it has been presented by the affirmative case, and is to be addressed by the negative, is descriptive (Descriptive moral relativism is merely the     positive     or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts obtain and the same consequences seem likely to arise(1)). If we are to make a claim about what IS about the Universe, we may appeal to this universal mind-independent medium we call the physical world. If we are to make a claim about what OUGHT about the Universe, what may we appeal to that stands outside the subjectivity of the mind? Logic of course, because all states on what ought are dependent on reasons, not proof….a crucial distinction. If Obama says that he believes that lying is wrong, and we ask him his reasons for believing that lying is wrong, all we are extracting from him is whether or not his belief is reasonable….and not whether or not he does in fact believe it. Descriptive moral relativism is not concerned with the reasons behind a subjective belief, but that the belief exists and only applies to a certain subject. Hence, I am to prove the truth of “Obama believes that lying is wrong”… and there is no reason for me to ask why he does.            Burden 2    When dealing with the nature of how the world IS there are certain necessary presumptions, the same presumptions that are necessary for argumentation, questioning of which would not only lead to solipsism, but incapacitate all canons of logic. My opponent’s decision to question such perceptions is ultimately argumentatively self-defeating, for he has cast doubt on the very faculties he used to form his doubt in the first place. This precludes such questions as, “How are you sure that your hearing of Obama saying he believes lying is wrong is real?”… or “How do you know Obama exists?”    Therefore it is within reason to take as fact that which has been physically verified…and if Obama says that he believes that lying is wrong that suffices to prove that he believes that lying is wrong.       Conclusion    Since all I must prove is that Obama believes that lying is wrong,…and physical proof of this MUST be sufficient by virtue of the assumptions of logic and argumentation,….all that is necessary for me to prove the truth of the aforementioned statement would be for Obama to physically state that he believes that lying is wrong. Hence, the descriptive subjective statement is physically verified, and the regression ends.       1.   http://en.wikipedia.org... ', 'I thank my opponent for his response. Allow me to address the crux of my opponents case, as he outlined it in this quote:    “  I contend that not only has my opposition not satisfied these burdens of proof, but his own argument states precisely why this is impossible. PRO states that \"When dealing with the nature of how the world IS there are certain necessary presumptions\" these presumptions constitute knowledge without justification, thus reaffirming the universality of Infinite regress[2]. If this is true and I contend that it is, then it cannot be true that Subjective Morality is exempt from Infinite Regress. In acknowledging this, PRO has sabotaged his case.  ”    There is a difference between a necessary and unnecessary presumption. Where our object is to find and acknowledge the most epistemically accurate position, we can only tolerate those presumptions that are necessary. I contend that the accuracy of human perception qualifies as a necessary presumption in both discourse and everyday life….and so therefore it is reasonable and logically necessary that we take that which has been “physically verified as true” as in fact, being true.    Conversely, it is not necessary to take that which has been given one reason, as being sufficiently warranted. The reason requires a reason, and so does that reason continuing   ad infinitum  . Denying each reason an objective self-sufficiency impedes neither discourse nor human operation….for we can live and argue with pure coherency under subjective sufficiency. However, like I mentioned, this is not the case for human perception and logic, which requires a definitive basis that must be assumed correct.    In summation, having Obama literally admit that he believes that lying is wrong   by necessity   satisfies the requisite proof, if it didn’t, and you questioned that Obama existed or that your hearing is real, you deny the predicates of discourse and reasoning itself. There is no such consequence when you deny the objective sufficiency of any one reason.    Thank you for reading, vote Pro. ', 'Both Pro and Con have shared burden of proof.

[A]ll executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.”   [1]     Early in the evolution of American government it was established, starting with Marbury v. Madison, that the Supreme Court held a special obligation to review the Constitutionality of laws,…deriving justification of this burden implicitly from the Supremacy Clause of Article VI. Since then, the role of the Judicial Branch and the federal courts have received definite form and character as the guardians of Constitutional law wherever it may be threatened.

Functioning as a national arbiter, it exists to be   virtually   “the final word.”    Hence, in order to fulfill my burden of proof I will demonstrate that the Supreme Court was firstly a net harm through is execution (ie. its consistent inability to objectively defend the Constitution), and secondly in its very design and existence as a political and national tyrant.

US (1941)    The Court ruled that restriction on the rights of people of Japanese descent was legal and Constitutional because they posed a threat to the safety of the U.S. Furthermore, this case made it legal to order Japanese Americans that had neither committed crime nor treason, into internment camps during WWII solely on the basis of race.    “  The     opinion, written by Supreme Court justice Hugo Black, held that the need to protect against espionage outweighed     Fred Korematsu\\'s individual rights, and the rights of Americans of Japanese descent  ” [2]     It is self-evident that this case destroyed the freedom of thousands of Americans under an unsubstantiated whim of suspicion and racism.             The Slaughter-House Cases (1873)    The Louisiana legislature passed an act granting the city of New Orleans the power to construct a Slaughter-House Corporation to “centralize all slaughterhouse operations in the city.” Then it proceeded to establish a government-enforced monopoly on this industry. When the Butcher’s Benevolent Association appealed to the Court that this was a violation of the equal protection, due process, and privileges and immunities clauses of the 14  th   Amendment, the Court found the state-initiated monopolization Constitutional on an insidious technicality. [3]    “  Harvard law     professor     Laurence Tribe     writes that “the Slaughter-House Cases incorrectly gutted the Privileges or Immunities Clause.” Similarly, Yale law professor     Akhil Amar     has written “Virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and center—thinks that Slaughter-House is a plausible reading of the     Fourteenth Amendment  .  ” [3]    There are multiple grounds on which one would find it unconstitutional for the government to institute and enforce a monopoly, but the 14  th   amendment and the establishment of equal protection is among the most apparent. What is the point of a Constitution if it may be interpreted so liberally that its laws can be misconstrued by a bloated Court to mean the opposite of what was stated and intended?          Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)    They ruled that State-enforced Segregation was legal insofar as accommodations were kept “separate but equal,” hence refusing to challenge or annul Jim Crow laws. The most indisputable aspect of this case was the fact that Jim Crow was separate and deliberately unequal. This serves as another disregard of the 14  th   Amendment by the same court, evidently rooted in the pervasive racist sentiment of the time. [4]    “  While in theory these laws required black facilities to be equal to white facilities, they very rarely were, resulting in blacks often being forced to use inferior facilities or not being offered facilities at all.  ”   [5]     Essentially, the Court  supported a set of laws that placed Black Americans in a position of inferiority, …while hiding behind the tenuous justification of  “separate yet equal,” fully aware that the laws were anything but.              Turner Broadcast System v. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (1994)    “     However, under the rule of     Red Lion     the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and Radio) with far greater discretion. In order for federal agency regulation of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means  .”   [6]    Again the Supreme Court widens the regulatory power of the FCC in direct violation of the 1  st   Amendment.             Employment Division v. Smith (1990)    It was decided that the government could revoke unemployment benefits from users of Peyote, even if the drug is used as part of a religious ritual. It is essentially a penalty on a victimless religious practice and both a disrespect to freedom of religion, and again that frequently ignored equal protection clause of the 14  th   Amendment. [7]            Buck v. Bell (1927)    The court ruled that compulsory sterilization (the governmental mandate forcing the mentally ill and diseased to undergo surgery for sterilization – as to prevent the passage of undesirable traits) was legal and constitutional.     “  It was largely seen as an endorsement of     negative eugenics—the attempt to improve the human     race     by eliminating \"defectives\" from the     gene pool  .  ”[8]    Since when did the government have the Constitutional authority to force surgery?          Bush v. Gore (2000)    This ruled that the Florida Supreme Court’s method of recounting the ballots was somehow a violation of the 14  th   Amendment. They then proceeded to use this nonsensical assertion to overtake a case that was below their jurisdiction! They refused to recount the votes claiming that Florida law did not allow them sufficient time, and narrowly granted George Bush the presidency in a majority of 5-4.    As demonstrated by these seven cases, the Supreme Court is a failure. It has failed to protect civil liberties where it was most necessary, and violated the limits of governmental power where it was most explicit.          Centralization of Justice    The Supreme Court is among the most powerful institutions in American government, yet it is also one of the most exclusive and radical in its distortions of Constitutional text. I contend that 9 highly partisan unelected individuals should not have the power to coerce an entire country.    No entity has the authority under American law to overturn a Supreme Court decision, except the Supreme Court itself. So, the word of the Court is the final word on the matter.     As a result, it has used this absolutist advantage to force policies of the nation that the public may not have agreed with. NINE people forced racial integration on a country perhaps unprepared for it (though segregation was wrong, one should not approve of this method). NINE people asserted power unto   themselves   in Marbury v. Madison! Nine people may alter the political and social atmosphere of the nation in a matter of 1 case. This power is the essence of despotism, and hence must be removed.

', 'I have to forfeit the remainder of the debate. Sorry for any inconvenience. Vote Con ', 'speeding it up ', 'Introduction  I accept, what I anticipate will be, a very productive debate.   Con is arguing that governments, namely the United States, should not give foreign aid to other countries.   I, being Pro, will be arguing that governments SHOULD give foreign aid.   definitions:  Foreign aid (1):   Is, but is not limited to \"economic, technical, or military assitance given by one nation to another\" Note that this can be given independent of alliances, so the quotes by the founding fathers addressed towards U.S involvment in alliances is irrelevant.   Should (2):   \"     Used to express obligation or duty\"   Since that is the base of the argument, con\\'s first reasoning for his position was that there are more negative than positive consequences for providing foreign aid. However, con agreed that it would be the moral thing to do.   In life, we are often faced with the question of \"what should we do?\" However, this question is answered through refering to a heirachy of justifications. Is this action legally correct? Is it morally correct? Is it more beneficial?.... As we think through these many questions trying to find what we SHOULD do, the highest and most important is, \"is it morally correct?\"   Christine Korsgaard (3):  \"[W]e must value our moral nature as what I call a form of practical identity, a description under which we value ourselves and find our lives worth living. I claimed that our moral identity, which I took to be equivalent to our human identity, is the ultimate source of reasons  ,   because the moral law is the ultimate source of justification   - a consideration must be capable of being embodied in a universalizable maxim if it is to count as a reason at all. So if we are to have any reasons, or to see anything as being valuable, we must value and identify with our nature as moral beings.\"  Hence, all that is necessary to prove that governments SHOULD give foreign aid, is the question of whether or not it is the moral and ethical course of action. Whether or not the action benefits or even puts the giving nation at a disadvantage is of lesser importance, as morality is the ultimate source of justification.   If I can prove that foreign aid is the moral course of action, then that means that governments SHOULD provide it, hence meaning that I have won the debate.    Refutations   1.   My opponent argues that there really is no spirit of giving in the method of forced taxes. Hence, the U.S foreign aid does not stem from a desire of the citizens to give, and a higher moral purpose.   *   I refute that taxes are not collected with the singular intention of providing foreign aid. Taxes, rather, are USED as a method of fuding foreign aid when necessary. Hence, while it is true that the citizens aren\\'t really giving, we must acknowlede that the government IS. Furthermore, with account for my earlier conclusion on how this debate can be won, this argument is irrelevant. Basically, con states that this aid is \"charity\" ( safe to assume is moral), but is costing the citizens as a result. The fact that the action is moral and charity is enough justification for why it should be done.   Unless this moral action is done through severe injustice on the citizens of the country, it SHOULD be done. We all know that there is no severe injustice created on the citizens by foreign aid, ergo, foreign aid SHOULD be provided   2.   The private charity defense.   *   Private charity is excellent, but  that does not mean that the government should not give charity, and only leave it to the private groups. There are certain matters such as natural disasters (Take what happened to Japan in April) that need the military, resources, aid, and simply human care of external nations. Private groups can only provide so much. So if your implication with that private charity argument was that private charities can take care of foreign aid, the government doesn\\'t need to, then that is factually incorrect.   Proof of my Position  1. My Opponent concedes that government foreign aid is moral.   \"...we, being in an affluent society, are morally obligated to give humanitarian aid. From a purely moral perspective, perhaps he is right\"   2. Morality is the unltimate justification, and all that is needed to prove that an action SHOULD be done (with the exception of the moral action creating injustice in the process. However, that is not the case here)   3. Hence, by transitive logic, my opponent concedes that governments SHOULD give foreign aid.   Back to you Paradigm!   (1)  http://www.definitions.net...  (2)  http://www.thefreedictionary.com...  (3)Valuing our Humanity. Christine M. Korsgaard. Professor of Philosophy, Harvard University ', 'Con makes a good argument. He refers to the misuse of foreign aid by foreign governments and refers to the hidden agenda possibly behind the offer of foreign aid.   HOWEVER,   he does so under a limited scope. He does not account for foreign aid in the event of an emergency.   Refutations  1.   Take the Haitian earthquake of January 2010 for example. Haiti is a nation torn in poverty, among the poorest on Earth. An earthquake of that destructive magnitude will be catastrophic. The country has no money to pull itself to its feet, and frankly its government is extremely corrupt. The influx of casual foreign aid, I imagine, is misused by the government, but are those the grounds to cut it off all together? The earthquake in Haiti was an example of an emergency. Guess who was the first responce? The U.S coast guard.  It took hours before private charities and the entire world was aware of this dire situation. How many people would have died had the U.S not helped?   It is not my intention to paint the United States as a hero of pure conscience, but it is a fact that without this aid, people will suffer. Without this aid, there would be one more family, homeless, starving, and dieing, wondering if the world even cares. Private charities cannot provide the same band of human beings to march down and help people like a nation can, in the same amount of time.   So, while I do acknowledge the prevalent misuse of government foreign aid, I stress that we must not cut off foreign aid as a result. When an emergency strikes and that foreign aid becomes of dire life and death importance to another human being, will we turn our back on him simply because of a change in policy?   We must find a solution for the misuse of tax payer money by foreign governments, but the complete removal of foreign aid, is NOT the answer.   2.   There is a shade of exaggeration in CON\\'s analogy.   \"   If I said that I pushed one kid off of a cliff in order to save one, one could argue that I did so under moral pretenses. But have I not sacrificed one moral for another in the process?  \"  The source of some of America\\'s problems does not stem from the single act of providing foreign aid. There is little evidence that removing foreign aid would even effectively solve its largest issues. So to assert that foreign aid is pushing America off the cliff is a bit of a strech, to put it lightly.   I stand by morality, as it is the highest justification for our actions.   CON stands by practicality, but it is not the highest justification for our actions.  It is PRACTICAL to cut off foreign aid, it will benefit the U.S a little, but it is not MORAL.   conclusion  It is within human nature to do what is universally recognized as ethical and morally sound. It is for this reason that there are those who will sacrifice their own lives to save another, whereas it would be more practical to live. We cannot go through with a course of action that is practical yet immoral, if we are to maintain our integrity as moral beings. Foreign aid in the event of an emergency becomes that question of morality vs practicality.   Once more, I truely understand CON\\'s concerns about the misuse of foreign aid, but we must attack that issue from a different angle, the cost of removing foreign aid is far greater and far more ghastly than the cost of having it. The U.S in particular plays a big hand in these emergency situations, if it removes that hand, things will get much worse for much more people. ', 'CON did not address nor refute my distinction on practicality versus morality, and continued his argument based on a purely practical basis. Each of his supposed \"well-sourced reasons\" are the same as they were in round 2.   1. From round 1, I established that human beings are moral beings, and morality is the highest justification for our actions. CON\\'s only refutation to this resolution was that he \"does not agree with Korsgaard.\" So, in effect, the resolution stood, as he did not concretely refute the statement.    2. CON, for each round regurgitated a plethura of facts and technicalities while trying to undermine and ignore the moral aspect of the debate.   3. Therefore, my argument is unchanged as well. Morality is above practicality.   4. FACT: It is the moral course of action to give foreign aid.   5. FACT: It is the practical course of action to NOT give foreign aid.  6. The point of morality being superior in justification to practicality went unaddressed.   7. Therefore, the U.S SHOULD give foreign aid, because it is the moral action, and the point of morality above practicality stands unchallenged.   I see no need for further explanation. ', 'I\\'d like to welcome my opponent to DDO,and wish him goodluck, on what should be an interesting debate.   C1. Charity does not interfere with the inevitable decline in the human population   \"  I feel that mother nature is fighting back, trying to control the worlds population but we keep on knocking her efforts  \"    A purely natural control of population works under   birth   and   death  . Unless people are not dying (which is impossible), the population will always behave according to the tendencies of population dynamics. Meaning: There will be a sharp increase and peak in population, a decline, and a stabilization.   If anything, charity, and allowing more people to live will hasten our global gravitation to human population stabilization. It will accomplish this by making us reach the Earth\\'s carrying capacity faster.   Point:   Charity is not bad for our population, rather, it assists our population.     C2. There is no such thing as a population \"problem\"   I am assuming that my opponent views the human race\\'s imminent over-population as something that is a problem and should be prevented. This is logically unsound. Every animal population, including us humans, must go through a. population increase b. population decline and c. population stabilization. The issues with living conditions that may arise due to population exponential growth, the scarcity of food and water, will be the driving force returning the human population to a period of decline due to increased deaths (of starvation and lack of resources).   The concern (due to misconceptions) that many have taken when thinking about the future of the human global population is unnecessary. We may think of ways to counter the future depletion of resources, but trying to prevent natural population growth is not the answer.  Point:     Charity cannot be bad for the population problem, if the population is not a problem to begin with.   \"  The several agencies that try to predict future population seem to be moving closer to a consensus that:        the world population will continue to grow until after the middle of this century              reaching a peak of some 9.3 billion (up from the 7 billion expected to be reached this coming October) and then              perhaps declining in the waning years of this century.  \" (1)          Sources    1.   http://users.rcn.com...

Round 1:   \" feel that mother nature is fighting back, trying to control the worlds population but we keep on knocking her efforts\"  Round 2: \"  Taking charity as it stands today out of the equation will slow the rate of population growth so we may never reach the 9.3 billion mark  \"  The notion of preventing the human population\\'s natural climax is contradictory to his previous point of letting nature take its course. First Pro states that we must not stifle nature, then the argument he provides directly stifles the will of nature.   If we do not peak, we will not decline  My opponent has made it clear that he does not want the human population to take its natural course and reach climax. He proceeds to ask me if I would prefer an 8.5 billion population to a 9.3. My answer is, I prefer a 6 billion population to a 9.3. When the human population peaks and the Earth does not have enough resources to accommodate so many people, there will be mass starvation and a period of sharply increased deaths. That will force the human population into decline.   Natural decline  \"  The human race has been trying to prevent a decline in population for time immemorial but have just gotten much better at it over the past 200 years  \"  No Source. Why would we deliberately let children and adults suffer to regain an 8.3 billion population, which is, as you implied, still above the Earth\\'s carrying capacity? Giving charity will not affect natures course. We WILL reach the population and climax, and eventually we WILL decline as I explained in the last round.   The addition of charity is a moral virtue, and its removal:  a. WILL NOT stop the eventual climax in population (that will happen no matter what)   b. WILL NOT prevent population decline (that too will happen no matter what)   Therefore Charity is not bad for the population \"problem\". ', '1. \"  There is no contradiction from round 1 to 2. In 1 I say that charity is affecting natures efforts to control population and in 2 I say charity is speeding up population growth the same argument from different sides.  The human population will climax, of course but charity will make that climax higher and quicker and will have detrimental affects on the planet.  \"  Simply stating that there is no contradiction does not actually conclude that there is no contradiction. I think I did a good job of explaining why a contradiction exists in the last round, so I extend that argument to the 3rd.   2. \"  I do not want a natural course to climax, rather I feel we need to act now in order to slow the growth, investing funds that keep people alive into making other people\\'s lives better  .\"  Pro\\'s wants are irrelevant. He will need to explain why not letting nature take its course would be a good thing......which AGAIN, he said would be a bad thing in round one. \"  feel that mother nature is fighting back, trying to control the worlds population but we keep on knocking her efforts\"  3. \"  There is no need to wait for mass starvation and death, it can all start right now. Rather embrace that things will get tough and work towards the greater good now.   \"  My opponent conceded that climax of population and hence, mass starvation is inevitable. So his call for action now by removing charity, will not stop the population increase. I would like to remind Pro of his resolution \"charity is bad for the population problem\". He has to prove HOW charity is bad for the population \"problem\" AND prove that the population is a problem. He has addressed neither burden. His point here of quickening the pace, and embracing the inevitable  by allowing more people to die is irrelevant to the resolution. This does not explain why charity is BAD for the population problem.  In fact, I even previously proved that charity is GOOD for the population by helping us reach population climax faster.You cannot skip over climax and force decline like my opponent asserts.

To start, I reject my opponent\\'s definition of a sound. It is insufficient to describe a quale in purely physical terms, since it has significance beyond its physicality. What I mean is, a sound isn\\'t just a mechanical vibration, but a perceived and mentally interpreted sensation. More accurately described by dualist Frank C. Jackson, the sensation of sound is \"  ..[a certain feature] of the bodily sensations... which no amount of purely physical information includes  .\"(  http://instruct.westvalley.edu...  )   Red is not still red to one who is color blind...despite the fact that it is the same light wave. A flavorful pizza isn\\'t actually flavorful on the palette of one without taste buds...despite the fact that the spices are still there. A sensation is a mentally processed experience caused by a physical catalyst, and cannot be accurately accounted for using only a physical description.   Therefore, what my opponent describes is a   sound wave  ,...not a   sound  . A conscious being must be present to   interpret   and   sense   the wave in order for it to be considered the latter. The conclusion follows, if a tree falls and no one hears it, it produced a sound wave, but made no sound. ', 'The definition of \"sound\" is the subject of this debate, and thus must be argued.  Pro\\'s distinction between a sound \"heard\" and sound \"made\" is incorrect. This is the resolution he would prefer: \"If a tree falls down and no one hears it, did anyone hear it?\". Obviously not. What makes this famous question debatable is the difference between a a physical thing and its perceived manifestation, and whether that thing has a full identity if it never reaches perception. In other words, is a sound really a sound if it is never perceived as such?   My opponent\\'s analogy about atomic decay and the emission of light falls under the same vain. Light is consciously interpreted in the form of colors, and thus has significance beyond its photonic physical manifestation. Red is not red, if no being sees it as such,...it is merely a light wave. The argument here is that light has a non-physical identity called \"color\"....and therefore cannot be fully described with a purely physical description. Suppose that \"red\" is defined as: The electromagnetic wave with the longest wavelength and smallest frequency on the visible light spectrum. That really doesn\\'t take into account the vibrant sensation of color that we consciously perceive, does it?   Likewise, describing sound as a mechanical vibration does not take into account our conscious perception of a sound. A tree will certainly produce a sound wave if it falls,... however, with no being to perceive and interpret it as a sound, it lacks that essential quality that makes it even fathomable and recognizable as such. Thus, the unheard sound is not a sound at all, but a mechanical wave and nothing more.   To my opponent\\'s contention about animals: the term \"no one\" refers to anything with the ability to interpret sound.  Conclusion:    Creatures sense things when a physical catalyst causes a mental sensation. However, the physical catalyist is not, itself, the mental sensation. Therefore a mechanical vibration is not a sound if no one hears it. ', 'I accept and wish my opponent good luck.

However, remember that the burden of proof requires you to prove the action of sending souls to hell logical, fair, or justified, so scripture will not fulfill the burden. ', \"I thank DakotaKrafick for accepting the debate.       My argument will center around the following syllogism:         P1: Hell is only justified if we have the free will to choose good from bad.     P2: We do not have the free will to choose good from bad.     C: Hell is unjustified.       P1: Hell is only justified with free will      The common justification for hell is that we choose our actions, and if we choose evil, then we will be punished. However, if I can prove that we ultimately do not have the free will to choose our actions, then hell is all but rational. In short, one would go to hell on the basis that he made   immoral   judgments while he had the option of making   moral   judgments. If this option to decide between good and evil is taken away, then hell would be unfair.     “  Argument that Free Will is Required for Moral Judgments      The moral judgment that you shouldn’t have done X implies that you should have done something else instead    That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do    That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else    That you could have done something else implies that you have free will    I  f you don’t have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn’t have done X  ” (1)           I believe this particular premise is relatively uncontroversial, so I’ll leave it at that for now.          P2: We do not have the free will to choose good from bad    I offer a deterministic argument in support of this, and ask that readers and my opponent keep an open mind in the process.    All human behavior is governed by external factors. We are who we are, not because we chose to be that way, but because things ultimately beyond our control, made us that way. I am not attempting to say that one cannot change his personality, but the fact remains that the will to change one’s personality is also governed by his own tendencies and externally developed character.     “  Children seem to have distinct temperaments almost from birth…Most psychologists agree that such temperamental differences are   biologically based and have genetic origins  .” (  2)    Please refer to Erickson’s 8 stages of psychosocial development:            (3)    You will notice that Erickson’s diagram postulates a positive and negative outcome depending on what events occurred during the respective periods. However, at no point in the development of human character is there an opportunity for active and conscious control over our personalities. Take stage 1 for example, concerning young infants. Whether or not one grows to trust others and gains the capacity to rely is wholly contingent upon whether he received food, warmth, and affection as a child.     “     If the parents expose the child to warmth, regularity, and dependable affection, the infant's view of the world will be one of trust. Should the parents fail to provide a secure environment and to meet the child's basic needs a sense of mistrust will result.  ”  (4)          What we do with our free will is governed by who we are, and who we are is governed by what we experience and how we are born. I understand the concern this argument may raise. For we do have the free will to change our personalities once we are adults. HOWEVER, whether or not we change our personality is dependent on our outlook on life, which is dependent on how we involuntarily developed as human beings. The issue of evil ultimately becomes a perplexing domino effect instigated by a series of uncontrollable and uncontainable factors that made us who we are.     Assuming a person has the free will to choose who he becomes, is like expecting a computer to program itself, it’s impossible.     Essentially, your conscious mind can choose good over evil, yes,…but the external factors that shaped who you are will DECIDE whether your conscious mind will choose good over evil.            In Conclusion    Hell punishes the sinful soul. However, there is nothing intrinsic that makes a soul sinful. If man sins, it is due to his upbringing, personality, and all that which governs his mental predispositions. If Hitler were born in a stable, affectionate home, had his siblings not died, had he done well in school, had he passed positively even a majority of the stages of development, who would believe that he would have still grown up to be who he became? “  The death of his younger brother Edmund     from measles   on 2 February 1900 deeply affected Hitler. He changed from being confident and outgoing and an excellent student, to a morose, detached, and sullen boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.  ”  (5)   We should ask ourselves, is hell really punishing an evil spirit,… or a victim of life?

God IS morality    My opponent's conclusion that God deserves hell presupposes two things: 1. God has free will. 2. God has done something immoral.       I find the first presumption rather indisputable. God certainly has pure free will. However, it is the second that should warrant close examination.      God:   “  the     one     Supreme     Being,     the     creator     and     ruler     of     the universe.”   (1).  By his VERY definition, by such a status, morality and God are intertwined. Morality is the method in which we ought to conduct ourselves in the Universe. So, what method could be superior to the one exercised by he who created it?         I contend that God IS morality. If God exists as the being which decides who does and does not go to heaven, then morality is the board of laws through which one would be accepted in heaven. If a God exists and a heaven exists and a hell exists, then we will act in a way that would send us to one of those places. That method of behavior is referred to as morality…and the degree of morality is measured by how much it agrees with the operations of heaven and the actions of God. In short, God's actions are the definition of that which is moral, so therefore he cannot EVER be immoral. Thus, either God does not do these immoral things we think he does, or our perceptions of morality are wrong.       If Our perceptions of morality are incorrect  So, let’s say that God sends people to hell unfairly. This would mean that all forms of unfairness are moral. Murder is unfair, that would be moral. Theft is unfair, that would be moral. Enslavement is unfair, that would be moral. So, if God does unfair things, then all things that humans do that are unfair are moral. So  , this would mean that neither God nor criminals deserve hell.       If Our perceptions of morality are correct    So, let’s say our perceptions of morality are indeed correct. This would then mean that God does not do what we think he does. My opponent would then have to prove that God does things contrary to what the average human would perceive as fair or just. If he cannot prove that God actually does unfair things, or sends people to hell at all to begin with  , then neither God nor criminals deserve hell.   I must admit, it is rather easy to prove God’s unfairness. However you should remember that this is only 1 of 2 options. If God’s actions do not agree with our sense of morality, then by default, our sense of morality is incorrect.  The only logical conclusion that follows is that no one, not even God deserves hell. God is morality, so he cannot be immoral. If God does things we think our immoral, then we are wrong, and those actions are indeed moral. Otherwise, God does not do them.  Conclusion  I, firstly, must thank my opponent for constructing one of the most creative and interesting debates I have participated in. However, I have shown that no human being can deserve to be sent to hell. I then proceeded to show that even God cannot deserve to go to hell. If you accept the option that human perception of morality is incorrect, then my Round 2 argument concerning how hell is unfair, would be invalid,…I understand.  HOWEVER, I provided new rationale for why nobody could still possibly deserve hell. I said that, if God is indeed unfair, that means humans are incorrect, and unfairness/injustice is still moral. That means all criminal actions under the sun that are unjust or unfair or cruel, would be permissible, since God leads by example. Then again, if you accept the option that God does not do immoral things to start with, he does not send people to hell, ever,…then my Round 2 argument would stand, and no criminal would deserve hell, and neither would God, since he does nothing immoral.    Through both options we find hell unjustified for ALL.  Therefore, please vote PRO. Thank you.

Flaw:     a feature that is regarded as unfavorable  Objective:   based on facts rather than thoughts or opinions  Round 1 is for acceptance. ', 'I derived that definition of \"flaw\" from Bing dictionary.  (   http://www.bing.com...   )    Both those definitions were conditions of acceptance, and if Pro found fault with them, he should have mentioned it before accepting so that I would gladly change it..but it doesn\\'t matter I suppose. I\\'ll go by his definition since he insists. The definition he gave as \"a feature that mars the perfection of something\" is an unusable definition since perfection is the absense of flaw, and the subjectivity of flaw is the issue in question. Therefore, I\\'ll go with his second definition.      Keep in mind my opponent\\'s definition:   A flaw is a defect impairing validity  ...      P1) Flaws are defects impairing validity   P2) validity is subjective   C)  Flaws are subjective        P1, This is our commonly accepted definition, as introduced by Con.         P2: Validity is subjective    How does one determine that something is valid? Well, something is valid if it acts according to our intentions, or fills our intended purposes. You may say a tv is invalid, hence flawed, because it will not turn on...but that presupposes that we INTENDED for the tv to turn on in the first place. Intentions vary from person to person, and while it is the manufacturer’s intention for the tv to turn on and display channels, it may simply be my intention for it to be used as a piece of furniture. Therefore, the tv is not flawed if it meets that purpose.     A flaw suggests that an object/person/thing did not meet a standard it was expected to meet. However, I don’t see how one can deny that standards vary. In order for Con to affirm that flaws are mostly objective, or mostly factual, he must affirm that STANDARDS are mostly objective or mostly factual. But there is no such thing as a factual standard – that is an oxymoron! By its very definition of being a standard, it implies that someone somewhere created it, and it does not exist beyond that person’s opinion.         P1 is accepted by both Pro and Con, and I have proved P2 correct as well. It logically follows that Flaws are entirely subjective. No matter how you look at it, a flaw depends on individual perceptions, whereas perceptions change. ', 'I thank my opponent for his response.    To start, my opponent’s argument is founded on a faulty syllogism. He writes:          “  P1  : Purpose creates objective flaws.     P2  : Our lives are mostly based around purpose/ finding purpose     P3  : Flaws are mostly objective  ”       Premise one is immediately false. Purpose does not create objective flaws. The sheer status as a “purpose” implies that someone established it. So it is not THE purpose, it is WHO’S purpose. There is no such thing as “THE purpose”….my opponent seems to mistake the manufacturer’s purpose for the objective purpose, when that equation is unwarranted. The manufacturer’s purpose is no one else’s but the manufacturer individually. So, yes it is true, that pencil was created to write,…yet it cannot write. However, if I give it new purpose, not to write, but to be a desk decoration, why should I still call it flawed, when it meets MY criteria of what it should be doing?     Purpose CLEARLY varies, and the manufacturer’s purpose is not superior to the individual’s purpose. If a thing does not fulfill its reason for existence, then it is flawed to no one else other than he who wanted it to fulfill that purpose.          Example:   Take the 1903 Wright Brother’s original airplane. Obviously it was created simply to fly, but it flew successfully only once. Today it rests in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C on display (1). The plane is not fulfilling the manufacturer’s purpose,…but it clearly fulfills a new one, to be a historical relic for the evolution of aviation. How does one justify calling the plane “flawed” if it is not intended to fly, but to stay and be used as an exhibit?     Purpose changes,…and to reiterate, there is no such thing as THE purpose but rather WHO’S purpose. I could easily call my iphone flawed because it does not make me breakfast. I could easily call this pen flawed because it doesn’t write my essay for me. YES, these are irrational expectations, but none of them are logically invalid. So, purpose is a wholly subjective factor, and thus gives variance to what is and is not perceived as a flaw.          Refuting my opponent’s examples:    “  Now imagine the music player can do all the above except play CDs due to the machine malfunctioning in some way, this would be an objective flaw, not opinion.”         Here again my opponent makes the argumentative error of assuming THE purpose exists, when it is really WHO’S,.. in this case my opponent makes an appeal for the inventor’s/manufacturer’s purpose. Again, I will prove to you with a common example why the manufacturer’s/inventor’s purpose is not sperior.             Example:   Silly putty was invented during WWII while attempting to create a synthetic rubber substitute, 2 chemicals were mixed together FOR THIS PURPOSE, …but wound up creating what children now play with: silly putty (2). Is silly putty somehow inherently flawed because it does not qualify as a usable rubber substitute,…or would you agree that silly putty has a new popular purpose, and that is a toy/slime to keep kids preoccupied?   Just because something was created to do X, does not mean I cannot give it a new purpose, Y.          “  Saying that \"flaws\" are mostly subjective would be like saying \"the answers to problems\" are mostly subjective. Answers to problems would be subjective if the equation being presented was X+X=, but once you filled the variables  with specifics like 2+2=,then the answer is objective.”         Yes, adding two things will get you an objective answer. 2 will always equal 2 no matter what because 2 is an objective figure…purpose is a 100% subjective figure, so it will change as perceptions and individuals vary. I honestly don’t see the relevance of this point beyond an attempt to compare something subjective to something objective.          Liver Example       This still does not prove that objective purposes exist. Biological purpose = purpose necessary for the human body to function (if we even accept that biology can have a purpose)….but if one does not need the human body to function and would not mind dying then what is flawed about a dysfunctional liver? You are right in that it is an objective fact that the liver is not functioning according to what it is biologically supposed to do. You are wrong in calling this a flaw, when there may be some that WANT their liver’s to kill them and consider that a good a thing.          Ecosystem Example       My opponent again neglects to establish WHO’S purpose and resorts to some mystical decree as to what an ecosystem is SUPPOSED to do. What if I said that I don’t mind if species die, a flawed ecosystem is one that does not have turtles       I have proved that purpose is certainly not objective, and neither are defects. A defect is only a defect if it violate an individual’s standards,….but standards vary. So therefore what is considered a flaw is indubitably subjective. Vote CON.

Secession and Anarchy  Lincoln stated in 1861 during his inaugural address:  \"   Plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.  \" (1)   As Lincoln explain, secession is rule by the minority. One small faction of a larger sovereign cannot individually decide to claim all sovereignty over itself. My proof exists on observance, for if such a claim were true, what would prevent mere households from becoming nations?   What is secession? In essence, secession is a mere disempowerment of authority. If a right existed to remove something from the rule of an authority at will, then the authority has no authority! Entities would simply declare their independence whenever decisions were not to their liking.   If South Carolina can declare independence from the U.S, then a county can declare its independence from South Carolina,...and then a city can declare its independence, and then individuals can declare independence. What then happens to authority? It has no power. There is no rule, no government, and what is left is the essence of anarchy, anyone can rule themselves at a moments notice.   As an article published in the New York Times (1860) stated:   \"  The ties that bind the States together will first be severed, and respect for law and order correspondingly weakened. Obligations to municipal laws will next be repudiated by a refusal on the part of the people to obey them. Next will follow the obligations between individuals, till neither persons nor property are longer respected, and forms of government become a mockery, because they   can neither command respect nor enforce obedience  .\"   (2)  To argue for a right to secession is to argue for a right to anarchy.   Reliquished Sovereignty   Imagine if 50 people had 50 individually owned pieces of wood and nailed it all together to form a building to house them all. Should one of the people be dissatisfied with the new living arrangements, can he simply rip out his plank, freezing the entire house, and be on his merry way? Of course not. The individual may leave, but he cannot take his plank because it no longer belongs to him. He relinquished INDIVIDUAL ownership of the plank for a joint ownership of the house. There was no settlement on the time that the plank would return to individual ownership, nor was there any talk that the plank must return. The default policy is that the arrangement is permanent until both the giving and recieving parties consensually agree on any changes.   \"  By ratifying the Constitution, the people   transferred certain limited sovereign powers to the federal government   from their states  \" (3)   \"  The United States of America consists of fifty states with   limited autonomy  \" (4)  Likewise, the state, through entry to the union and ratification of the Constitution relinquished INDIVIDUAL sovereignty over itself to form one united sovereign. Secession takes away the plank (sovereignty) from the house (The United States) when that sovereignty was not theirs for the taking. This is not to mean that the state has no sovereignty, it is just that the DEGREE of sovereignty that would permit it to secede was handed to the United States. There is no expiration date on the Constitution, and there is no mention of this Union even having to ever end. Therefore, the default policy is that the Union is perpetual until there is consensus on secession.

The ideas could not be logically separated at times.         Rebuttals  My opponent mentions as his opening argument that \" the moral obligation to respect autonomy justifies secession.\" However, the unanswered question is, to what degree must we respect autonomy? There are parameters on autonomous rule because of the necessity for government. I will show in my ensuing rebuttals that secession of a U.S state exists outside these parameters, and can therefore not be respected under moral obligation or be justified.    The Parameters of Autonomous Rule     Limitation 1:   Only sentient beings can be OWED morality. An inanimate THING/CONCEPT cannot be owed morality.   A GROUP of humans can be owed rights. However, the state is not a group of humans. The state is a political structure manifested in a mass of land with very limited sovereignty. The state is a THING. THINGS are not owed morality.       The United States federal government is not the proxy and embodiment of Americans. Likewise, the state is not the proxy and embodiment of its citizens. The state is a political entity, existing only on a political map. The state therefore, being independent of the people, cannot hold the same rights as the people. Can a state government bear arms? Can a state government have free speech? Can state governments rally and protest against its federal superior? No. These are rights exclusive to human beings. Likewise, autonomy, under the assumption that this is a right to begin with, cannot be MORALLY obligated to a being that is not human. Autonomy is therefore not a RIGHT to which can be morally enforced when regarding secession.     The notion that the state is the manifestation of the people simply does not carry. The state is a vacuous entity that HOUSES the people. The people may leave their nation at will in a hypothetical spontaneous mass exodus, but the state itself must always stay. The sovereignty of the land to which the state resides is a plank in the house. The state, essentially, gave out its sovereignty AND total autonomy when signing the Constitution and forming this house. How can it, without proper conditions such as successful revolution or consensus, reclaim something it relinquished? It cannot.     50 people used their own 50 planks to build a house for all of them to live in. Anyone of those PEOPLE can leave the house forever if they wish, but they cannot ever take back the plank, because it is no longer theirs. That plank is STATE SOVEREIGNTY & AUTONOMY, and that house is the United States.  Limitation 2:     Anarchy  My opponent stated: \"  The significance of Kant\\'s argument is that we have an obligation of upholding morality.Therefore, whenever a violation of morality exists, there also exists a reciprocal obligation to remedy this violation.  \"  It is the requirement, using deontological ethics, that we must uphold and enforce morality, and punish its transgressors. However, how can one enforce anything if he does not have the power to do so?   If people are to uphold a moral norm, what would stop individuals from seceding and rejecting that morality, free from persecution? The idea of secession is destructive of the establishment of any morality. Entities would simply leave when they disagree or are dissatisfied with that moral code.   If we look at the secession of Southern America prior to the civil war, we see that it left primarily to escape the moral impositions of the federal government. South Carolina\\'s \"Declaration of Immediate Causes\" reads:  \"[The federal government]   encroachments upon    the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the Federal Union; but in deference to   the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this right. Since that time,   these encroachments have continued to increase, and further forbearance ceases to be a virtue.\" (1)     They merely left when the federal government and northern faction of the nation tried to enforce a moral rule. If we have an obligation to enforce morality, like my opponent interprets Kant\\'s words, then we have an obligation against secession.    How can an authority excercise its power if the bodies it governs may disempower them at any point? Lets look at this on a more minute scale. When my town passes a law that I dislike, I would suddenly be able to reclaim sovereignty over my private property and declare independence from America, on my 20 by 20 yard patch of land? This is anarchy in its purest form.   Conclusion  We see that autonomy has two primary limitations that constitutes its parameters. One is the fact that THINGS, CONCEPTS, non-sentient objects, cannot have natural rights or be owed morality. The other is that secession is anarchy, and hence self-destructive of any moral code that endorses it. It simply has no moral bearing in a society that requires government, law, and authority.

Rebuttals  Contradiction in the argument for Kantian Ethics   \"  When I explained that we have an obligation to remedying violations of morality, I never justified positive obligations.  \"  My opponent is basically saying that Kantian ethics does not require us to do something, it only requires us to not do something. He however still maintains that we have \"an obligation to remedying violations of morality.\" This is a flat contradiction.   The obligation to rememdy is a positive obligation in and of itself, as it requires us to do something. There is no such thing as a negative obligation to remedy because remedying is an action, not an inaction.   Natural Rights for THINGS that are not natural?  \"  However, organizations are prescribed natural rights, and thus may still secede. Organizations are moral agents. Wilmot (4) explains,    \"[W]e can find cognitive attributes such as perception, reasoning, co-ordination and implementation; and moral elements such as rationality and respect in many organisations; and that organisations on that basis [can] be treated as moral actors with moral dispositions.\"      Thus, states are moral actors and can have natural rights  .\"  The quote my opponent presents attempts to put sentient qualities to inanimate things! Organizations cannot rationalize. Organizations cannot respect. Organizations cannot perceive. Organizations cannot reason. The PEOPLE in organizations are the one\\'s who do those things. My opponent conceded that states/organizations are inanimate entities that exist independently of the people who run them. Yet, he turns around and mistakes the moral qualities OF those people as the qualities for these non-sentient political concepts. In short, pro essentially asserted a non-conscious THING the ability to think.   In light of the fact that an organization such as a U.S State is mutually agreed to be a THING, I maintain the argument that things cannot think or act in moral manners. An organization/state merely projects the morality of the sentient beings that drive them. It does not mean that the organization itself has somehow become sentient. Therefore, it does not mean that the organization/state can be owed morality or natural rights.   Hence, a state cannot be owed a right. ----> A state of America has no \"right\" to autonomy.    Relinquished Sovereignty Argument Defended  \"  Now, my opponent\\'s final limitation on autonomy is the relinquishment of sovereignty. This represents a legal occurance, and what is legally true. However, what is implicated legally is not what ought to be implicated morally  \"  From what I proved in the last argument, the only FORM of obligation that can exist to a THING is a legal form. Objects cannot wield morality or be owed morality. Therefore, the only kind of rule that exists over a concept like the state is a legal one. Now, I am aware that the state must be moral to the people it governs, but I stress that it is actually the PEOPLE of the state that must be moral. If our secession argument was about the right of the PEOPLE of the government to leave America, then I would be fine with that. However, this is about the object, the state itself, the organization itself, being able to secede.   The object of the state is only bound by legal inclinations. It is the people that run and operate these entities that are bound by moral inclinations. Therefore, if I can prove it is not legal to secede, I prove that secession is not justified in any form, as legality is the only remaining form that exists for such an object.   Extend my relinquished sovereignty argument which proves that secession is illegal. My opponent would have to refute this legal argument to get anywhere.   Anarchy  \"  I agree that this is legally true. However, as we can see through Kant\\'s argument, while we are not morally obligated to secede, we are morally obligated to protect our own autonomy and refin from violating that of others. Thus, secession is morally justified, as if we secede, we remove these limitations from our autonomy. If it leads to anarchy, even better. If there is no government, there can be no limitations on autonomy as nobody has legally seceded autonomy to any other body.  \"  Pro\\'s entire argument was centered around the assertion that states are moral agents. Having disproved that, I suppose that destroys the foundation of his other contentions. This argument he provides here is also invalidated due to the fact that states are not owed morality. So even if anarchy is good and in line with Kantian ethics, such does not apply to the state which is only bound by legal inclinations.   The fact is:  1.

If pro insists that he does not have to prove anything, I hope the reading audience and voters will side with me, and take that into account when voting.   Since pro did not begin his opening argument, I'll just use this as a round for acceptance. I look forward to a very interesting debate. \", 'Nearly every statement in pro\\'s argument was riddled with fallacy and subjective conclusions. I will address each one by quote. This will be my negation of pro\\'s arguments. Afterwards, I will provide my own case as to why secession was not justified legally OR morally.   Negation  1)  \"  The South was justified in leaving the Union because, at the time, the action of seccession was legal  \"  1N)  AT THE TIME,  secession was actually unconstitutional and hence illegal.   Article 1, Section 10 of the United States Constitution (1):      \" No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation\"   2) \"   The North was slowly chipping away at the institution of slavery which was, at the time, extremely important to the economy of the South  \"  2N) FALSE. the South was trying to EXTEND slavery to the new territories, but the North would not allow it. In the events leading up to secession, slavery in the states that ALREADY had slavery was unchallenged. The North, while many individuals wanted slavery gone all together, was still not fighting for the eradication of slavery, rather, it was fighting against the SPREAD of slavery to the territories gained from the Mexican-American War. The Compromise of 1850 and the Wilmot proviso were among the proposed legislative plans to arbitrate the controversey of spreading slavery. Therefore, the argument that the North was clipping away at slavery is historially and completely factually incorrect.  3) \"  The South\\'s leaving of the Union was not only an act of self preservation, but a (a the time) legal act of   peace\"  3N) FALSE. There was nothing peaceful about the southern secession. They forcefully attempted to rob a fort from the federal government of the United States. That led to a battle we recognize as the battle of Fort Sumter, the spark of the civil war. In a peaceful secession the South would not have attempted to claim a fort that belonged to America. That fort was on southern land, but rightfully so, because that southern land is U.S land first and foremost. Secession did not imply that federal institutions situated on that land became the property of the Confederation. That is theft.   4) \"  While slavery is surely unjust, do not think for even a moment that the North was for equal rights/freedom or anything like that. The North\\'s primary goal in abolishing slavery was to economically weaken the South.\"  4N) Here is the first example of a subjective conclusion from pro. He has made an assumption that is not only historically unsupported but very prone to challenge and defeat. Hence I will challenge and defeat it. The North was truely against slavery because it was not a part of their society. This fact allowed them to see slavery through an eye of ethicality.   Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin   by Harriet Beecher Stowe is one of the many northern attempts to attack slavery from a moral perspective. Had the North only cared about destroying southern economy, (an argument that makes no sense since the South, after all, is still a part of America), then they would have only gone about doing so on a legislative and Congressional basis. They even helped free slaves to Liberia and the Northern states. It is an imperceptive conclusion to assert that the north genuinely did not care about the morality of this subject, when their actions and history suggest otherwise.  Furthermore, it is ubsurd and frankly quite asinine to believe that the north was only interested in destroying Southern economy. That would be a suicide mission as the distruction of southern economy would also mean the harming of American economy, and transitively the harming of Northern economy.  Pro forgets that the U.S is still ONE country even though there is sectionalism.   5) \"\"  Honest\" Abe himself even campiagned that he had no interest in abolishing slavery, he only did so as a way to punish the South for it\\'s seccession.\"   5N) Lincoln did infact use the emancipation proclamation to punish the south, but to declare that he had no interest in abolishing slavery is PARTLY false. He did not want to abolish slavery, yes, but only because of the fragility and political implications of such an action. By theory and belief, Lincoln was strongly opposed to slavery. He was a member of the Republican party which did not like slavery. If slavery was not so firmly attached to southern life, Lincoln would have attacked it politically. Basically, pro is trying to make it seem as if the north and the president didn\\'t really genuinely care about the morality of slavery, and that, as I have proven, is very false.   6) \"  At the very least, the South was honest about how they felt about the Negro\\'s. The North, sadly, was not  .\"  6N) As I have proven in the last 2 negations, this statement is false. Furthermore, for the progression of this debate I will have to request that my opponent refrain from using the offensive and provocative gutter language of the South at the time unless used in the context of a quote FROM a southerner of that time. The use of the word \"Negro\" is not politically correct, appropriate, or of good taste and conduct even in a debate pertaining to slavery. Thank you.   Proof  Why did the south secede? Because they feared the republicans would abolish slavery, so states seceded the minute a republican president (Abraham Lincoln) was elected. This was unjustified on a legal and moral basis.   1) Secession is illegal  Article 4, Section 3 of the United States Constitution (2):  \"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States\"   It is the implication and subtext of this excerpt that the territory occupied by the United States belongs to the country as a whole (\"the country as a whole\" being represented by the federal government), and no particular state individually. The limited jurisdiction of the states over the political map does not imply ownership of the land thereof.   1. THEREFORE, the land of the states by geography are subject to regulation and authority by the federal government through CONSTITUTIONAL DECREE.   2. Secession would lift this authority  3. Lifting of said authority is illegal  4. Secession is Illegal.   5. And I will refer again to the constitution saying that no state can join another Confederation.  2) The south\\'s reasoning for seceding was not moral.  1. They wanted to keep slavery, one of the most immoral practices in human history. They seceded to do evil. This is not proper reasoning for leaving the Union.   2. The very fact that the south seceded to keep slavery is sufficient proof that their reasoning is not morally justified.   In conclusion, the south indeed was NOT JUSTIFIED in seceding. ', 'I thank my opponent for what is revealing to be a very entertaining debate.   DEBATE DIRECTION  1.  My opponent\\'s resolution was that southern secession was justified. Justification, for simplicity\\'s sake, comes in 2 forms: moral justification, and legal justification..  2. My opponent, In round 3, has conceded that the south did indeed secede to keep slavery, and slavery is immoral, ergo he concedes that southern secession was not morally justified. It is not my intention to put words in his mouth, but by agreeing to the 2 mentioned points, there leaves nothing more to debate.  If something is immoral, then the action of doing it is immoral as well. His only defense on this point was that the north was not morally justified either, but as you can see, that is not the subject of this debate, so that point has no warrant.   3. Therefore, the remainder of the debate will consist of proving whether or not the south was legally justified. I will only refute my opponents points that pertain to secession legality because that is all that is required, from here and on for me to prove that the south was not justified, and hence all that is needed for me to win.   REFUTATIONS  MY RESOLUTION: Secession was and has always been illegal through retroactive court rule and interpretation of the Constitution.   \"  Con says that secession was illegal because of Article 1, Section 10. That\\'s very interesting, however it is false because when the South left the Union...they were no longer states! Remember, the legality of seccession was, at this point, unclear and as such the legality of it could not be assessed. Article one aplies to only states, the CSA was a different country  .\"  1. The CSA did not exist as a recognized and legal entity. The states did not have the power or legal right to form the CSA. Why:  a. RETROACTIVE SupCT. case Texas v. White. Chief Justice Salmon Chase (1869)[1]:  \"  The Union of the States never was a purely artificial and arbitrary relation. It began among the Colonies, and grew out of common origin, mutual sympathies, kindred principles, similar interests, and geographical relations. It was confirmed and strengthened by the necessities of war, and received definite form and character and sanction from the Articles of Confederation. By these, the Union was solemnly declared to \"be perpetual.\" And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained \"to form a more perfect Union.\" It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not?  \"  1. It was the RETROACTIVE rule of this court that secession is an act that contradicts the intent of the Constitution. Their reasoning stemed from the quoted introductory phrase of the Constitution \"to form a more perfect Union\". They proved that it was never legal to secede.  2. While my opponent may disagree with this ruling, it still stands, as the Supreme Court is the highest court and the judicial power affirming what is legal in the United States, and what is not. Because of the, again RETROACTIVE, ruling of Texas v. White, it is the irrefutable, unnegatable, and irrepressable truth that by law, it was indeed illegal to secede.   3. Something cannot be illegal, yet legally justified. HENCE, the south was not legally justified in seceding either.   4. The remainder of PRO\\'s points are either without warrant, or irrelevant to the topic of secession legality, so they need not be negated.    SUMMARY  MORALITY JUSTIFICATION  1. PRO and I agree that slavery is immoral.  2. PRO and I agree that the South seceded to keep slavery.   3. Therefore, PRO and I agree that the South seceded to do something immoral.  4. An action cannot be immoral, but morally justified. It is a contradiction.   5. THEREFORE, PRO and I agree that secession was not morally justified.   LEGAL JUSTIFICATION  1. The Supreme Court interprets the Constitution and decides what is and is not legal. Unless the case involves amending the Constitution and referring to that new addition, the rule is RETROACTIVE (key word here).   2. Since the decision of Texas v. White was retroactive, it means that secession was NEVER legal.  3. Something cannot be illegal, yet legally justified. It is a contradiction.   4. Secession was and always will be illegal.   CONCLUSION  Since PRO and I transitively agree that secession was not morally justified, and I proved in an irrefutable and final way (by referring to the ultimate source of proof) that secession is not legally justified, I urge that the South was not justified in seceding.   Vote CON.  * On a side note  About the \"negro\" comment. I will ask you once more to refrain from using that word. It shows very poor conduct. It is irrelevant whether that is a word you grew up hearing, I ask you to conform to the rules of common society and this website, not my own rules. It is incredibly vulgar to use a racial epithet of such negative history in a civil debate. If you continue, you may be penalized by the voters.   [1]   Texas v. White  , 74 U.S. 700 (1868) at Cornell University Law School Supreme Court collection ', 'The resolution stands.The supreme court ruled that secession was illegal. The supreme court is the ultimate proof, right by the Constitution, of what is and is not legal in the United States.

The south seceded to keep slavery. Slavery is immoral. The South was not morally justified.   Given that southern secession was not justified in either faction of the concept of \"justification,\" I urge that the South was not justified at all in seceding.    Vote CON. Thankyou for reading. ', 'Determinism:   Given entirely identical preceding conditions,   nothing else   could happen. (1)     Free will:   The inverse of determinism.

No semantics.   1.   http://en.wikipedia.org...  2.   http://en.wikipedia.org... ', \"I thank my opponent for accepting.  I will meet the BOP from two principle angles: philosophically (where Freewill violates logic) and scientifically (where freewill violates physics).              The Dilemma of Determinism     P1: Either determinism is true or it is false    P2: If determinism is true, then all actions are inevitable, thus freewill does not exist    P3: If determinism is false, then all actions are random, thus freewill does not exist    C: It is impossible for freewill to exist    Premise 1     invokes the law of excluded middle, which should make it logically valid. I don’t think it needs much explanation.    Premise 2     can be justified by Peter Van Inwagen’s “Consequence Argument.” It asserts that if we have no choice as to whether the laws regarding the universe are true, and all those laws dictate determined actions, then we have no choice as to the occurrence of those actions. (1) Having no choice as to the occurrence of one’s own actions is the negation of freewill.    Premise 3     can also be justified using Inwagen’s “Mind Argument.” He states that “  an act that occurs by chance, if an event that occurs by chance can be called an act, cannot be under the control of its alleged agent and hence cannot have been performed freely  .”(2) We can form this premise knowing that either actions are random, or they are caused. Where an action has no cause, it must be random. If my opponent objects, he should name an example where this is not the case.    Given these three premises, it follows that freewill cannot exist.            Neurology     Rapid growth in technology has led to startling neurological discoveries, all of which completely support the theory of Determinism. I will present them in the order of progressive significance.           Libet’s Delay     Benjamin Libet’s experiments in the late 20  th   Century measured the time lapse between decisions, consciousness, and actions. Using electrical stimulation and a clock face oscilloscope to determine the time of awareness, they found that there was a 500 millisecond delay between a neural event and the subject’s conscious awareness of it. This led to the conclusion that “  the perceived time at which we make a decision must be subjectively referred back by 500 milliseconds. Unlikely as it seems, and contrary to our own impression, we must have made our decisions slightly before we actually became aware of them”  (3)       Study no. 1    Twelve right-handed subjects (aged 22-29) were tested using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the University of Leipzig. They were placed in front of a screen, showing a descending cascade of letters. They were then to press either a button to the right or to the left at random, then report what letter was on the screen at the moment of their decision.    This was the conclusion:    “  In summary, we could replicate the finding of Soon et al.     [30]     that motor intentions were encoded in frontopolar cortex up to seven seconds before participants were aware of their decisions. Using ultra-high field fMRI on a 7 Tesla scanner, we could show that these patterns became more stable with increasing temporal proximity to the conscious decision. These findings support the conclusion that frontopolar cortex is part of a network of brain regions that shape conscious decisions long before they reach conscious awareness  .”(4)       Study no. 2     An   experiment conducted by neuroscientist,     John-Dylan Haynes in 2008 modernized Libet’s experiment using fMRI. They were able to predict which button a patient would press (left or right) with 60% accuracy. (5)          Study no. 3    As part of a surgical procedure conducted by surgeon and neurologist, Itzhak Fried, electrodes were implanted deep in the brains of the patients to precisely monitor their neuronal activity before pressing a button. It was found that their decisions could be predicted with 80% accuracy 700 milliseconds prior to the patient being aware that he had made a decision.  (5)          Impressive Results    Professor Patrick Haggard from the London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience goes even farther than the aforementioned studies. He proves that the human mind can be coerced by outside forces in the universe. He demonstrates “transcranial magnetic stimulation” using magnetic coils held over his head while simultaneously measuring electrical activity in his muscles. When his assistant presses a switch to activate the coil, his fingers twitch.         “  Christina controls Prof Haggard's fingers like a marionette. The mechanical nature of it is unsettling. A graph on a screen shows his muscle activity plotted by time; 20 milliseconds after she clicks the button, it depicts an elegant leap and drop, like a heartbeat on an ECG. That 20 milliseconds is how long it takes for the signal to travel down his nerves.  ”(6)    T  he conclusion here is a definitive negation of the spiritual will. As Haggard explains,     “  We don't have free will, in the spiritual sense. What you're seeing is the last output stage of a machine. There are lots of things that happen before this stage – plans, goals, learning – and those are the reasons we do more interesting things than just waggle fingers. But there's no ghost in the machine.     (6)            Conclusion    Empirically speaking, the evidence against freewill is mounting. Along a scientific framework, it will be difficult and eventually impossible to reconcile this concept with what we know about the mechanics of the mind. I’m looking forward to my opponent denying science. Along a philosophical framework, Freewill is blatantly absurd. The concept doesn’t seem to fit anywhere using logic. Therefore, the conclusion follows, freewill likely does not exist.

His arguments rest on the unjustified presupposition that our immediate perception is a correct depiction of actuality,….this is a blatant case of Mind Projection Fallacy. In addition to this, he also presupposes Dualism without justifying it first.       Rebuttals       The problem of fatalism    Unless I am mistaken, Pro is using the consequence of a truth as evidence against its validity. It is obvious that Determinism results in almost all necessary truths. However, unless my opponent can demonstrate how this violates logic, all his argument reduces to is “  Determinism does not sound right  ”. This reasoning is tenuous at best.            Self-Defeating Determinism    My opponent conflates probability with believability. The likelihood of a theory being true has no bearing on the likelihood of it being believed. Through making such an argument my opponent appeals to human bias rather than the factual merit of the theory.    Furthermore, he claims that Determinism undercuts rationality, giving us no basis to support it. However, a careful look at what necessity entails would suggest the opposite! Determinism tells us that our thoughts and actions are subsequent necessary reactions to prior events. This is isn’t non-rationality, this IS the essence of rationality. In the process of reasoning, logic is the causal law. If our thoughts are spontaneously generated from nothing or uncaused then they would be non-rational. Outside of thought, logic still governs everything in the form of mathematics.    So, if one is rationally deliberating, his sequence of thought is determined by logic,….else he is not rationally deliberating. Other thoughts that occur to us are still not free. The sheer act of speaking or thinking of what to say is a reference to memory. We do not choose what words reach our consciousness first, the process of memory retrieval is a determined one. “  Successful and accurate remembering depends on the interdependent relationship between encoding and retrieval processes in the human memory system  ”(1)       Sometimes brain damage leads to forgetfulness,…whereas if the mind was independent and uncoerced in the manner my opponent supposes, this would be impossible.     The evidence of a necessary causal link between the conscious thinking process and the physical events within the brain is tremendous. We cannot think without a brain to   cause   us to think, and that brain itself is ruled by a causal chain of events bound by physical laws.            The Argument for Libertarianism     My opponent’s whole argument presupposes Dualism. That is why he considers the mind a separate substance…and hence not subject to be determined. However, no compelling empirical evidence suggests that the mind is a substance and a thing independent from the body.    What I propose is a monistic explanation of the mind and the body - meaning that all seemingly mental phenomena can be fully explained and accounted for by physical neuronal events (i.e the conscious conception of pain is simply from the firing of c-fibers in the brain (2)). The concepts of reasoning, choosing, and qualia all fall under this category.    If Dualism is false, then as is my opponent’s whole argument for Libertarian Free Will. I have demonstrated that the mind is really a physical sensation. Now my opponent must justify that it isn’t.    Also, if evolution is true, then the conscious human being evolved from unconscious things. Given that the laws of the Universe are constant, and we have demonstrably evolved only in the form of matter. Our consciousness could only have arisen through physical matter. Unless of course some spiritual entity endowed us with it somewhere along the way,… in which case my opponent  holds quite an enormous BoP to prove that such exists.          Kane’s Freewill    This is a disappointing argument. Behind the argumentum verbosium is a massive assertion. My opponent suggests that we   seem   to have alternate possibilies,…and we   seem   to make self-formed choices,..therefore that is the reality of the event. Libet’s experiments along with the other studies demonstrate these perceptions as an illusion. My opponent has yet to demonstrate that it isn’t an illusion.  Conclusion  Pro's argument does not pass muster as a concrete employment of facts. He relies on immediate human perception to justify things that require us to escape it. Like the Earth is not flat simply because it appears flat, Man does not have freewill and possibilities and choices simply because he thinks he does. If this issue is seen from such a narrow perspective, Pro's argument would seem naturally correct, but the nature of the debate requires a more objective view. With that, I await Pro's response.        Sources    1.    http://suite101.com...    2.    http://en.wikipedia.org... \", \"Introduction    My opponent has run away with the point on distrusting   immediate   perception. There’s a very good reason why I put that adjective there. Determinism does not render the perception inert,…then  it really would be self-defeating. Rather, my point is that we’re seeing the issue of freewill from a naturally incomplete perspective. Determinism does not argue that what we experience is false,…it argues that it is misleading. Pro’s entire case is a ridiculous caricature of the arguments put forth.    Pro has also yet to prove that the mind is separate from the body. I’m unsure how anyone can corroborate something so outlandish, but it still needs to be proven. Appealing to what we   think   is true is a weak argument.               Dilemma of Determinism    Yes, the question is whether we are free to want. And the argument states that a want with no necessary cause is arbitrary. A want with a necessary cause is determined. If wants originate from nothing, they MUST be random. If they originate from something, they MUST be determined.    My opponent’s argument that such logic is inapplicable to the mind rests on the premise, again, that Dualism is true – QED. However, this is not even a physical argument, this is a logical observation. For my opponent to call it inapplicable suggests that the mind does not abide by logic in the way we think it does. Who has the self-defeating argument now?            Neuroscience       Study 1    Conceded – only because Libet’s technology was old. We have more accurate means of addressing this problem.            Study 2    “  Matter doesn't have   teleos  . Humans experience   teleos  , therefore our minds aren’t reducible to matter.”    The conclusion does not follow. Purpose is derived from consciousness. Matter can produce consciousness. Therefore, matter can produce purposes. His argument is abusive in that it makes one think of an inanimate object, like a rock, having purposes,….when really it is an assembly of matter of unfathomable complexity, such as the human brain, that we say produces purposes.     “  Also nobody even knows when/where consciousness is! How can anything at all be said of it     a posteriori     when we still just experience it     a priori  , as free?  ”     That is because consciousness is not a physical thing. Consciousness is an experience. We observe consciousness a posteriori through the machine that produces this sensation.    “  But a scientist who presupposes naturalism can’t speak on awareness.”    They can speak on awareness because of the strong correlates between neural activity and the sensation of thought. The critical fact that Pro is ignoring is that the neurologists could   predict   decisions with well over 50% accuracy! A will that is free is spontaneous and unpredictable. A will that is free can decide on anything it wants and it would be incalculable by an outside observer. These scientist   predicted   decisions….  accurately  ….hundreds of milliseconds   before   they occurred. Speaking of the more probable case, it’s safe to say that the mind isn’t a totally separate substance. My opponent has not and cannot reconcile this spontaneous otherworldly concept of the mind with these findings.    and so long as we’re quoting Philosophers’ opinions of their own departments:            “ Most contemporary philosophers given a choice between going with science and going with intuitions, go with science. Although I once dissented from the majority, I have capitulated and now see the interesting issue as being where the arguments from the intuitions against physicalism—the arguments that seem so compelling—go wrong.”   – acclaimed Dualist Frank Jackson                      Objections to Determinism          Fatalism     This really isn’t an argument. The whole debate revolves around me proving the reasonability of Determinism. It doesn’t make sense to start squeezing arguments under this heading.              Self-Defeating Determinism    “An interactionist mind also cannot retrieve damaged information (stalemate again). We would expect the mind to improvise, which is exactly what we observe the effects of for blind people, etc; their lobes for hearing improve. (Science Daily)  ”    Pro is refuting himself. What does it mean to retrieve information? Knowledge, according to the dualist, is stored not in the brain but the mind. If the processes in the brain cannot determine what we think, but rather what we think determines what occurs in the brain, then we cannot know things because the brain transmitted it to our consciousness. We must know things because knowledge already exists in the mind. The idea that we lose memory, a.k.a knowledge, from physical events is not compatible with the Dualist’s theory.       Also, consider again the argument from Evolution:    Conscious humans evolved from unconscious organic chemicals. In this process, matter is the only driving force of the evolution, therefore consciousness can only be accounted for through matter. If he rejects that and says that consciousness is a spiritual concept,…then he suggests that consciousness was inserted into the evolving human at some point in time. This carries a tremendous burden of proof to demonstrate who or what is responsible for the insertion, and when this occurred. Moreover, on a faster scale, babies go from a mass of inanimate cells to a living organism. When does their consciousness kick in, if not through matter? What inserts their consciousness in there?  The evidence suggesting that consciousness is generated by matter is pervasive. It should only follow that dualism is improbable, so as is LFW.            Kane’s Freewill    This is a reconciliation with responsibility under what my opponent concedes is a   perception   of freewill. This has no bearing on whether freewill is true.            Conclusion    I understand that this is an extremely contrarian position to hold, as it questions our most intimate understanding of human existence. However, judging freewill only through   immediate   perception is like judging the depth of a lake by looking at its surface. One must look through multiple angles and conduct thorough investigation before he can make an objective conclusion. \", \"Considering the narrow scope of the resolution, I have limited the debate to 2 rounds of argument and 3,000 characters maximum per round. I will prove that Kant's categorical imperative is a preposterous invention and all imperatives are hypothetical. Whereas, Con will attempt to prove that the categorical imperative exists.   Categorical Imperative:     an absolute, unconditional requirement that allows no exceptions, and is both required and justified as an end in itself (  http://www.wordiq.com...  ;)  - essentially a reason-less obligation.   Round 1 is for acceptance \", 'Introduction  Human beings do not obey moral laws like matter obeys the laws of physics. Physics sets laws in the form of boundaries. Thus obedience of these occurs within the realm of SHALL. (You SHALL do X, for there is no other option.) Obedience of moral laws occurs within the realm of OUGHT (therefore they are only applicable to willed creatures holding the ability to obey or disobey those laws.) Where there is will, there is the option to do X over Y or Y over X. Where one CAN do X instead of Y, there must be a rationale for whatever option was chosen, for reason is the catalyst of predetermined action.            Argument     P1: All  “  oughts”    must have a condition of “  if”   in order to exist    P2: Categorical Imperatives are “  oughts”   with no “  if”  .    C: Categorical imperatives do not exist.          P1: All “oughts” must have a condition of “if” in order to exist       There is no such thing as “I ought to do X.” The logical statement is that “I ought to do X, if I want Y.”       Saying that one “ought” to do X implies 2 things:       1)  He has the freewill to do otherwise.       2)  He must ALWAYS do X as though that freewill did not exist.       The statement “one ought to do X” is vacuous and meaningless in that it has no warrant or justification. If we were dealing with subservient creatures, then a declaration of law without warrant would be logical, since it doesn’t have the freewill to do otherwise. However, once the freewill to do otherwise exists, there has to be a justification for the supremacy of one action over the other. Justification can range from “IF one wishes to be moral, he ought not kill” to “IF one fears the wrath of God, he ought not kill.” However, the notion that autonomous creatures are logically bound by empty declarations is simply inconsistent with their willed nature.       Any uncorroborated statement like “we ought to X” is a direct contradiction of the natural human will…which dictates that we may do X, Y, or Z. It forces a suppression of the rational consciousness through its creation of unjustified laws. If human beings were MEANT to objectively follow such assertions like “we ought to do X” – empty of a desired end, then we wouldn’t have the free will to NOT do X.        “  Even apart from the fact that Kant’s theory of the “categories” as the source of man’s concepts was a preposterous invention, his argument amounted to a negation, not only of man’s consciousness, but ofany   consciousness, of consciousness as such  \" (1)            P2: Categorical Imperatives are “oughts” with no “if”       The Ethics encyclopedia describes:       “     By contrast, a categorical imperative simply mandates an action, irrespective of one’s personal desires, such as “You ought to do X.  ”     (2)       This premise is rather self-evident.            Conclusion  When Kant writes “We ought to do X. Period”…he is asserting a premise-less law, and we do not obey premise-less laws for that is a direct contradiction of our rational and autonomous nature.

Counter-Argument     It appears that my opponent has cold-dropped my argument from Round 2 and has instead proposed a plan in which I rebut his, but he never rebuts mine (from Round 2). Furthermore, and more importantly, my opponent’s response cannot be considered an argument. At no point in his rebuttal did he even attempt to justify the categorical imperative; he merely   explains   and   defines   it. So, in short, his argument is “Kant says so, therefore it must be true.”    The following statements made by Con need justification, yet lack it:          1.   “  [the hypothetical imperative] is corrupt because it stems from human perceptions which are not pure.”     The wording is ambiguous, and the claim is unwarranted. Firstly, on what grounds does my opponent assert the human perception “impure” and what exactly is meant by that claim?             2.   “  This statement \"I ought to do X\" is made because it is a moral obligation  .  ”    Anything can be asserted to be a “moral obligation.” My opponent needs to justify why certain actions must be done irrespective of personal desire. He then further needs to justify the supremacy of certain actions over others.             3.     “  Kant says that you ought to always tell the truth period. There are no circumstances tied to this statement.  ”    There has to be a reason for this statement. If it were rational to assert compulsive declarations without reason, then I could just as easily say “everyone ought to jump off a cliff.”  Through the exigencies of this debate, it is thus necessary for my opponent to justify compulsive statements like the categorical imperative with reason.    Whenever my opponent decides to assign a reason to the claim “we ought to always tell the truth,” the statement immediately becomes circumstantial. That reason serves the purpose of an   end  , and the statement of ought becomes the   means  . Thus, the ought will only apply to those who agree with the end, or the reason.       To clarify and summarize this argument I present this syllogism:       P1: All imperatives need reason     P2: Reason is subjective    C1: all imperatives are subjective     P1: a subjective imperative is a hypothetical imperative    C2: all imperatives are hypothetical     C3: No imperatives are categorical            4.   “  The universal law  ”    This, like every other part of my opponent’s argument, is not justified. For what   reason   should moral statements be universalizable? Here is a perfect example of my opponent defining rather than substantiating.     The other 2 definitions my opponent provides fall under the same assertive vain, and thus the same refutation.             Conclusion    I spent round 2 outlining the illogicality of categorical imperatives through the necessity for reasons, and the existence of the human will. My opponent did not refute it, but provided his own argument for his share of the burden. However his text consisted mainly of a lesson in ethics and Kant’s beliefs than a cogent justification of them. I therefore strongly encourage you to vote PRO. ', 'In accepting the debate, Pro agrees to the following parameters and definitions.  Inherently:   Occurring from birth; within the very genetics of the group.  Round 1: Introduction of the Affirmative Case (by Pro)   Round 2: Rebuttals and arguments  Round 3: Rebuttals and arguments  Round 4: Rebuttals and conclusion (no new arguments on either side)  No semantics.   My opponent insists on receiving the final word, so contrary to the common debate structure, Pro will begin his argument in Round 1 and I will refute it in the following round and so on and so forth.    Without further ado, I await an honest, good willed, and challenging debate and wish my opponent good luck. ', 'I return the thanks to my opponent for accepting this debate.  Introduction  Allow me to clarify the terms of the debate. My opponent and I have indeed agreed to equate IQ to intelligence, agreed that inherent refers to genetics, and agreed that Caucasians refer to Caucasian Americans. However, my opponent has mischaracterized his burden of proof. Having the duty of affirming the inherent intellectual superiority of a race suggests a direct and pervasive causatory link between Race and IQ. Let it therefore be established that to meet this burden, my opponent must not merely \"show that [IQ] is partially influenced by genetic factors.\" He must show that IQ is   principally   influenced by genetic factors, for if it is not, then IQ is not inherent.  My opponent brought up a plethora of evidence in support of IQ differences and the inheritability of IQ. However, I need not refute them because I do not object to them. Those points neither address the resolution nor prove a race-based linkage - which my opponent neglected to mention in his entire argument as a matter of fact. That said, I will pursue my own burden by showing why race genetics cannot be the principal determination of IQ.   Race-IQ Disparities? :  The African American Immigrant  If the IQ disparities of African Americans and Caucasian Americans are race linked, then one would expect to see the same roughly equal average intelligence in any sub-group of the African American race, regardless of background. However, an overwhelming wealth of evidense suggests the opposite! African American immigrants residing in America are   THE   most highly-educated group in the United States. In addition, African American immigrants tend to exceed the average Caucasian American score in IQ, automatically defying the race-IQ direct causation.   \"  Among African Americans, class divides exist between blacks native to the United States and foreign-born blacks, with the latter achieving higher incomes and levels of education than the former. In fact, the U.S. Census indicates that African immigrants to the U.S. are the most highly educated group of people in the entire country.  \"(1)  \"  So that if one accepts the research suggesting direct casual relationships between academic attainment and IQ (Gottfredson, 1998; Ostrowsky, 1999) the median IQ for African blacks residing in the west should be about 110! This is especially true for those living in the United States and in the UK. One may also expect to find, according to much of the “corroborative” literature that relates IQ with education, approximately twice the number of African born immigrants with IQs in the 115 range, than among the general white American population (Gottfredson, 1998; Ostrowsky, 1999; Williams, 2005; Nisbett, 2002); and more than twice the number of African immigrants in the 125 IQ range..  \" (2)   (3)  I cannot stress the stark contrast between African American Immigrants and Native African Americans enough. If there are two groups of the same race but entirely different backgrounds, then they should both still have roughly equal averages in intelligence, and they should both still have roughly equal IQ rates. However, the fact that a different background has led to such success and intelligence proves that there is a component more powerful than genetics in the overall determination of IQ. The explanation for projected IQ gaps then becomes a matter of environment rather than inheritance.  I know that this debate is focused more specifically towards the United States, but I will briefly add the statistics from England to further dismantle the theory of the inherent intellectual inferiority of the African race.   \"   In fact, blacks with African origins over the age of 30 had the highest educational qualifications of any ethnic group in the British Isles. Thus, the evidence pointed to the fact that minority quotas for University admissions were actually working against students from these ethnic groups who were on average more qualified for higher education than their white peers (Cross, 1994; Also see, Dustmann, Theodoropoulos, 2006)  .  \" (4)  The Phenomenon of the Flynn Effect  The Flynn Effect essentially denotes a universal progression in IQ through time. These differences are visible in a matter of generations, increasing by 3 points per decade. (5) Prima Facie, this evidence would suggest that man was becoming more intelligent with time. However \"   Flynn himself does not believe this to be the case. It is conceivable that something about modern society (the greater need for abstract thinking, presence of computers, more visually-oriented culture) is responsible.\" (5)  The Flynn Effect virtually shuts down the notion of a dominantly genetic determination of IQ for very starting reasons. For one, in order for Pro to explain the Flynn Effect, he would have to demonstrate that genes are collectively changing consistently, progressively, and continuously at the same rate and time for everyone in the world,....a statistical absurdity. Since the only way genes can be changed is through the formation and subsequent inheritance of mutations (6), he\\'d also have to show that everyone is receiving the same mutations and passing them on, a self-evident improbability.   So, ultimately, the Flynn Effect proves that there is something else that is non-genetic and powerful enough to significantly alter IQ in such a widespread and pervasive manner. If IQ is so drasitcally alterable by non-genetic factors in a matter of decades, then racial genetics clearly does not have a principal role. Genes do not change that quickly!  \"   Since the black-white difference in IQ is 15 points, this means that an even larger IQ difference has existed between different generations of the same race  , making it no longer necessary to attribute IQ differences of this magnitude to genetics.  \"(7)  Conclusion  If African Immigrants, people of the same race but different background and upbringing show such a drastic and collective deviation from the projected African American norm, then there is obviously a reason for this occurrence outside the boundaries of race genetics. Also, if the Flynn Effect, which is widely accepted and acknowledged to occur, does indeed occur, then it implies a force on IQ that is more dominant than genetics could be, since it is virtually impossible to explain the Flynn effect using genetics. So, in short I have proven that genetics cannot be the principle arbitor of IQ, so it follows that intelligence disparities if they do exist are not necessarily \"inherent.\"    Sources  1.   http://racerelations.about.com...  2.   http://www.africaresource.com...  3.   http://s1.zetaboards.com...  4.   http://bluecafe669.blogtownhall.com...  5.   http://www.wordiq.com...  6.   http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov...  7.   http://townhall.com... ', 'Introduction  : The Burden of Proof          What my opponent offers with his talk of “averages” is an extreme perversion of the general consensus of what is inherent. If Americans, on average, are fatter than Europeans, does that mean that America is inherently fat? Averages do not address the resolution or Pro’s burden of proof.         \"  If we accept that genes are largely responsible for height in group A and B (which both reside in the USA), which I hope everyone would, then we can say group A is \"inherently\" taller than group B. This is, again, despite the fact that there is no \"group A or B\" gene that is linked to height, and this is also despite the fact that there are individuals and individual groups within group B, the shorter group, that are taller than the average member of group A  \"    Pro is confusing the genetics of the individual with the genetics of the group. How can he select an arbitrary group of people and then call the arbitrary fact that they are tall an inherent trait of that group? Pro seems to want to make the argument that African Americans are on average less intelligent than Caucasians, but that doesn’t actually suggest or prove or evidence that this observation of lower IQ is inherent to the genetics of that group. There is a reason why inherent was added to this resolution – not to play a game of semantics, but to establish a correlative link, genetic predisposition or aptitude for lesser Intelligence in the genes that   define   the African American race. If my opponent cannot prove this inherency or correlative link, then he cannot reach the conclusion for which he must affirm.      He may then say that “an individual” African American (or any member of any race for that matter) is genetically, and thus inherently less intelligent, but he may not say that African American(S) are genetically, and thus inherently less intelligent, for that addresses the race as a whole, thus implying that this intelligence (or lack thereof) is embedded in the genes that   define   that race.    Back to my opponent’s example: If group A is on average taller than group B, then unless group A and B are both dichotomized and succinct entities sharing a multiplicity of genes in common as to make them 2 distinct and separate races, then this height differential is nothing but an arbitrary fact and is not intrinsic to the group. That said, it is clear that my opponent’s example ineffectually strawmans the issue at hand.     The African American Immigrant    Pro’s only attempts to refute my African Immigrant argument were these:    Quote 1    “  Only the smartest and most skilled people from Africa come to the USA, so they can get a good education and have a higher standard of living. So, when we are talking about African immigrants, we are talking about a very selective group that is not representative of the actual African population.  ”    Quote 2  “  Furthermore, African immigrants only made up 0.2% of the total USA population in 2000. African Americans as a whole made up 12.9% of the USA population in 2000. This means that African immigrants made up less than 2% of the African American population in 2000 [1,2]  .  ”    Quote 1, needless to say, is an utterly unfounded assertion that my opponent conveniently neglected to support with some statistics, references, or sources. Because my opponent has no explanation for this influx of intelligence from Africa he casts it down as some kind of anomaly, and then even goes as far as to say that only the most intelligent come to America.    Quote 2 points out that only 0.2 % of the total US population consists of African Americans. This is not a refutation to my point. I am not trying to prove that the average African American is intelligent, nor am I trying to prove that most African Americans are intelligent. I am, however, proving that intelligence is more contingent on the variable of environment than race. My opponent seems to be ignoring the fact that the intelligence is highly concentrated on the immigrants of Africa in hopes that I would too.         Let us approach this contention using the scientific method:    Question:   Is lesser intelligence   inherent   to the African American race?    Hypothesis:      If the African American race as a whole is   inherently     less intelligent (meaning that their race genetics is the PRIMARY reason for their IQ), then this lack of intelligence should be constant regardless of other variables.       - Other variables,   if proven to completely change the outcome of the experiment  , can then be assumed to be the cause of any projected intellectual inferiority, not genetic inherency.    Control:   The African American race    Variable:   Environment    Experimental Data:    1.   Native African Americans in the United States are often descendants of those subjected to slavery and segregation. They thus are born and raised in the very same antiquated neighborhoods and communities that their grandfathers and great grandfathers were subjected to live in as a result of discrimination and inhumanity. Such environments restrict potential, provide inadequate education, and wane opportunity...such environments are referred to as “the Ghetto.” The South was the predominant source of American racism, segregation, and discrimination, the South was the primary proponent of slavery, and ultimately the primary abode of African Americans. Let us see where African Americans live today:                             They Still live in the South! They still live in the same area because poverty begets poverty; those born in poverty are likely to stay in poverty. The injustices of history that subjected this demographic to ghettos is still the very reason for the denigration of this race in America.             2.   African Immigrants for the most part were not subjected to segregation or slavery. They have come to America for a better life, so will thus live in better environments and have better opportunity. They come to America with a blank slate, no specific history of subjugation and sociological retardation, no enclosure in an already failing neighborhood, they are free to live well and show their fullest potential in the land of opportunity and guess what, they turn out to be staggeringly intelligent as a result!         “  Compared to other immigrants, the African born tend to be highly educated and speak English well.  ”   (2)          “  U.S. Census data from 2000 indicate that black African immigrants have the most education of any population group in the United States. Indeed, they even have higher levels of academic achievement than Asian Americans.  (3)     Conclusion:   I have used the scientific method to conduct a brief research experiment, and I have found that with a different environment, intelligence within the same race radically changes. As a result, my hypothesis (Jimtimmy’s hypothesis) was   FALSE  .            The Flynn Effect    “  Now, as you\\'ll notice, both groups had their average height increase by an incredible 4 inches each. This could be called the \"Flynn effect\" for height.     However, the 3 inch gap between average height in both groups stayed the exact same during this time period.  ”    My opponent does not understand the point I was making in referencing the Flynn effect. I was not trying to show that the projected gaps were decreasing; I was showing that the Flynn effect is proof that IQ changes drastically with outside variables, so genetics cannot be the principle explanation. So, please carry over my explanation from last round here, as I’m out of characters.            Points I Allegedly Dropped     MTAS, G-loaded IQ tests, and inheritability of IQ all proved that there were IQ gaps between Native African Americans and Caucasians. I don’t object to them so I see no need to refute them. They also don’t address the issue of inherency. I do, however, apologize for dropping the brain size argument I will address that in the next round.

Introduction: Average =/= Inherent           “   all I have to do is show that there are genetic influences on these height differences for me to show that group A is \"inherently\" taller than group B.”  ?The average American is fatter than the average European. Therefore Americans are inherently fatter than Europeans?    genetics of the individual =/= genetics of a race.    My opponent needs to prove that IQ is carried by racial genetics, not individual genetics...else how is it inherent to the race?        African Americans    “  As I said, only the smartest Africans immigrate to other countries with better education systems and higher standards of living.     My opponent was rather dismissive of this seemingly obvious explanation. He does not explain why he is so dismissive, but he does criticize me for not having a source. In fact, we do know that African nations have very low IQs. In fact, the average IQ in African nations is lower than the average IQ of American blacks [1].”    My opponent proceeded not to find a source for the assertion that “only the smartest come to America.” The “[1]” you see in my quote of Pro is a source showing that African nations have low IQs, not a source showing that only the smartest come here. My opponent seems to think he’s helping his case by pointing out IQ scores in Africa. However, the reality is that many African countries are in cultural turmoil, political disarray, and domestic inadequacy. The schools are dilapidated and educational resources are scarce. There’s mass starvation, malnutrition and lack of opportunity (1). Only those born into decent living conditions and some money have the ability to travel and succeed. The less fortunate, born into poverty stay there in squandered potential. I don’t know why my opponent thinks it fair, accurate, or sound of mind to take those living in squalor and use their resulting Intelligence Quotients as proof of the innate inferiority of their race.    Pointing out the low IQ rates of poverty-stricken Africa would be the cross-racial equivalent of testing all the poor and uneducated Caucasians in America and using their inevitable low scores to argue that Caucasians are not intelligent. In order to determine genetics as the principal ruler of IQ, we must first subdue all other variables or points of contention. We must take individuals from Africa and give them the same environment and tools that their Caucasian counterparts were given and then allow their natural abilities to shine through undisrupted.     I have understood this necessity for controlled experiment from the very beginning. I gave you cases where the environmental field was level, and showed you that this so-called gap seems to vanish under such conditions. I have showed you that if you take an immigrant from Africa and place him in the United States, he will excel. I have showed you that if you pull a Black American from deteriorated neighborhoods  and into an environment of affluence and adequate educational tools, he will succeed. In the face of this IQ fluidity according to environment, it is a difficult assertion to establish that IQ scores are a pure manifestation of innate racial genetics. IQ changes drastically with outside variables. This is a point I will not let my opponent ride roughshod over.         Twins    Twins are genetically identical human beings sharing 99% of the same genes. If there is a pervasive genetic component of IQ then we should expect to see little to no variability in the IQs of twins raised in separate backgrounds. However, this is consistently not the case. Some studies in which twins were tested in opposite socioeconomic backgrounds yielded opposite IQ scores. The twin from a poorer background scored less than the twin from a more affluent environment.        The Flynn Effect    “  However, if the white-black IQ gap, which is the topic of this debate, were not genetic, then we would see this gap narrowing. However, over recent decades, it has actually widened slightly. This would suggest that the white-black IQ gap is genetic in origin.”    This is false. For what reason or evidence does my opponent suggest the gap would narrow? If the factors of poor environments still hamper the African American race in comparison to other races, then the difference will certainly not reduce.     “     The increase in average IQ test scores can easily be explained by the improving environment helping the 15% to 25% of IQ tests that are not genetic  .”    This is also false. My opponent clearly acknowledges that environment plays a role, but now it appears that he wants to diminish that role to a level of insignificance that is completely absurd. The Flynn effect has the power to account for 5 to 25 IQ points (6). This far exceeds the projected gap which is 15 IQ points (Black – 85, White – 100). Changing environments has the power to account for well over 15 IQ points in a controlled experiment. My opponent’s numbers of “15% - 20%” are complete nonsense. I provide you with 2 separate studies in addition to my other quotes proving that environment is powerful.        Brain Size      This was my opponent’s only  attempt to address inherency. However this feeds into the original resolution. The same reasons that we see Blacks on average to score lesser IQs is the one that accounts for brain size. Brain size is not a reflection of inherency, but it is rather a reflection of body proportions. The mass starvation and rampant disease in Africa are the reasons for retarded growth and transitively average smaller brains. In short, brain size is contingent on body size and body aspects. If you take a race who’s majority is in starvation  (Africa), expecting them to have average brain sizes equal to the rest of  the more affluent worlds is a tremendous feet of unfairness.  I believe this quote explains this point excellently.      \"  . In mammals for example, 90% of all variation in brain weight can be explained by variations in body weight (Jerison 1973). Differences in body size are used also to explain why women, on average, have smaller brains than do men (Peters, 1991; Gould, 1981) and why these differences in no way reflect that the level of male intelligence is higher than female intelligence  .\" (8)  Conclusion  I have proven that Pro’s use of averages, standing alone, says nothing about what is actually genetic. I have proven that environment is larger than genetics in the overall determination of IQ. I have proven that much of Pro’s projections can be attributed to non-inherent influences. I have proven how IQ plummets and rockets depending on external variables like socioeconomic status, quality of education, and availability of tools to build intelligence. It is thus a distortion of reality to assert some races inferior to another because they arbitrarily developed in such a way. We have seen the proof, now it is our burden to decide what is and is not honest in the views proposed.       In words of \"  Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned, everywhere is war and until there are no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation, until the color of a man\\'s skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes. And until the     basic     human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race, there is war.  ”         Thank you for reading. Vote CON.

FULL RESOLUTION:   The debate system (of DDO) allowing the contender to have the last word, is fair.    Round 1: acceptance  Round 4: Rebuttals only (as usual) ', \"My argument will be centered around 3 contentions.   Allowing the contender to speak last is fair because...:   C1. It allows both opponents the same amount of speech.  (1)  1. In every conversation, every argument, every debate, and every moment of human interaction someone will always speak last, unless two people speak at the same time, then ending the conversation. On a turn based online debate, this logic is even greater observed. Since it is inevitable that one person will speak last, it becomes a question of who that will be. Both debaters should get the same amount of turns and speech (of course we all agree on that). So, the only way that is possible is if the contender speaks last. If the debate begins with the instigator, in order for both people to get equal chances to speak, it must end with the contender. No matter how many rounds there are, this law is true.   Therefore, it is an act of FAIRNESS to allow the contender to speak last, rather than the unfairness my opponent perceives.  C2. If a voter sides with whoever speaks last, then HE is unfair and not the system itself.   1. The system, again, allows both debators equal opportunities to speak. If a voter has a tendency to be more convinced by whomever he heard last, then that is his flaw. The debate system cannot be blamed for the wrong and unjust decisions of voters.  C3.  There is usually nothing very convincing in final rounds  1. The final round is for refutation only. If the instigator's closing arguments were so weak that the contender could easily dismantle them and leave that lasting victory impression on the readers, then that is the fault of the instigator for being so inept. In any debate containing over 3 rounds, most powerful points would be exhausted by the final round. If someone withholds his powerful points until the final round, those points will be disregarded by fair voters and the person would lose conduct points. Basically, there is no advantage for speaking last unless an unfair voter, or unskilled instigator makes it an advantage. The system of debating in and of itself is fair. (2)  Sources  1.

A system that leads to unfairness is unfair.  \"  Basically, what my opponent did was repeat his resolution as a method of refutation. Therefore, my point and my reasoniing still stands unnegated, that voters would be unfair for being swayed so easily by external factors, and not the system.  2.   \"  The contender has last word these are the words most fresh in the voter (and any readers) mind at the conclusion of reading the debate. In addition the instigator cannot respond to what was last said. the instigator may have a very good rebuttal or the contender may have made a mistake or inaccuracy and the instigator is powerless to respond to the contenders statement. This puts the instigator at a disadvantage.  \"  Again my opponent has neglected to address another one of my major points in the second round. \"  there is no advantage for speaking last unless an unfair voter, or unskilled instigator makes it an advantage. The system of debating in and of itself is fair.  \"He mentions that the last word is fresh in the mind of the voter. It is the voter\\'s responsibility to vote fairly. If he really does not remember, as you say, the instigators previous arguments, then he should re-read it.   3.   Now notice how my opponent conveniently replied to one of my arguments without refuting it.   \"  I agree that giving each side equal time is fair. However there is an unfair side to it. That makes it unfair. My opponents point seems to be that since there is no alternative it is fair. It seems his source is this debate itself. I disagree with this Logic\" that since there is no alternative that makes it fair. Further more I question how my opponent concluded that there is no alternative. In fact I put up a thread in the forums and got some responses.  \"  In a turn based online debate, and in any conversation for that matter, someone must speak last, unless both people speak at the same time....but that isn\\'t possible when typing. My opponent has yet to provide a circumstance under  which no one spoke last, and I truly doubt he can. When typing, someone will inevitably get the last word. The only obligation of the system is to allow everyone equal speech opportunities. Since the current DDO systems allows everyone to speak equally, it is fair.   Faulty Statistics  1.   \"  The \"top\" debater on ddo (i.e. most experienced ddo debater): In the past 9 debates has been contender every time winning 9 0ut of 9 that means in her past 9 debates she choose contender every time and won every time  .\"  This can easily be explained, as there are strong variables that lead to this result. Members contend on debate resolutions that have intrinsique fallacies or simply weak supporting arguments. Or, they contend because they simply know that they have more powerful points. This makes for an easy win for many contenders. This, again, falls under the fault of the instigator for being so inept, and not some unfairness from the system. Here are a few examples of contended arguments with obvious faulty resoluions. (1)(2)(3)   2.   \"  an impressive 94% win rate, 4 out of the past 5 debates was contender.  \"  My opponent did not provide a source to this statistic, so I can only treat it as a mere assertion. Ore_Ele, A member who has received a spreadsheet of every debate on DDO, has a different statistic \"  Historically, the Contender wins 65.4% of all debates. Given that this applies to 12,500+ debates, that is hard to say that there is no correlation. We also see this trend leaning more and more towards the Contender, with the last 5,000 debates favoring them 68.9%.  \" (4) Now I have this quote here to nullify my opponents previous statistic, even though this new statistic still favors my opponent....at face value.  (4) Ore_Ele went on to explain that the reason for his statistic was probably not because of a tendancy to side with contenders but rather because of the inexperienced newcomers that instigate debates  . DDO gets a healthy influx of newcomers (5) and many of them start debates that sets them up to lose. With Ore_Ele\\'s statistic being inclusive of those erroneous newcomer-instigated debates, that could easily explain the shft in contenders winning. So this particular statistic is not a viable source of evidense against this so-called unfairness.   3.   Same above refutation applies to the remainder of con\\'s \"statistics\"   In Conclusion  My opponent has yet to actually refute that someone MUST speak last. Until he can negate it, the statement stands. Since someone has to speak last, it MUST be the contender (if both people are getting equal speech). That is the fair action. If a tendancy exists in certain voters to side with who they heard last, than that is their own personal weakness. Maybe they should look over the instigators arguments again very quickly. The decision of the voter is the voter\\'s responsibility. If he is convinced by who\\'s voice he heard last, then HE is unfair, and we cannot blame the system. Therefore, the DDO debate system is fair.

So, in my opponent\\'s OWN EXACT words,....\"The #\\'s speak for themselves.   vote pro  \" ', 'This is the last round, and as usual, there can only be rebuttals. So I will not introduce any new points, only refute my opponent\\'s.   Counter Rebuttals  1.   The Voter who sides with whomever he heard last is unfair, not the system.  My opponent repeated the same statement from the last round, \"  I maintain a system which leads to unfairness is unfair.\"   He has still made no substantial or logical opposition to my conclusion. He proceeded to provide two impertinent examples that showed and demonstrated nothing. If a court room is painted blue, (example 2) and the jury voted with that influence, then the jury is unfair. The duty of a voter is to look at the facts from an unbiased point of view, resist outside influence, and vote on whomever has proved to be correct. This is a VOTER\\'S responsibility. Should he fail to achieve that mindset and allow himself to be influenced by frivolous factors like last word, and a blue courtroom, then he and he alone is unfair.   Readers, my opponent is blaming inanimate factors rather than the people subjecting themselves to their influence. Imagine a chair, neatly tucked under a desk, where it should be, stubbing your toe on it, and blaming the chair. That, in effect, is what my opponent is doing.      2.   Someone will inevitably speak last, so it must be the contender  This was my opponent\\'s reply to this contention:  \"  even if there is no way to make it that no, one side goes last it is possible to make other changes to counter the last word advantage. The following is a sample listing of suggestions proposed:  b1)The following was from CD-Host in forums:  \"  I am arguing that the last word is not an advantage by nature. It is only an advantage if an inept instigator or unfair voter MAKES it an advantage. Note that this is my THIRD TIME saying this...once in each round.   My opponent has deviated from the subject of this debate. He proceeds to provide examples on how to offset the last word advantage, as if we have both reached consensus that an intrinsique advantage (brought on by DDO\\'s system) exists in the first place.   With that in mind, I will disregard his examples and all pertaining to it, and continue proving that an inherent advantage does not exist.   3.   My opponent responded to my explanation for his statistics with this:  \"  With such a large gap of nearly twice as many contenders to instigators winning can hardly be blamed on these factors alone. In addition there are some minor factors which would cause instigator to win these include a)more research time. b)instigator more frequently has BoP. Despite these reasons, Contender wins nearly twice as often that can hardly be explained by my opponents reason alone.  \"  Now, I mentioned before that Ore_Ele is a member who has received a spreadsheet of ALL debates ever made on this website. This is his explanation for Con\\'s statistics:  \"  The likely reasons are because...  1) Instigators are often new members that will not finish their debates (they can also accept debates and never finish them, but it is more likely they\\'ll start one).  2) Instigators often start with their arguments in R1, so the potential Contenders will not accept unless they are confident that they\\'ll win because their opponent has revieled their hand.  3) Contenders are more likely to find and exploit semantic arguments to get a technical win.  \" (1)  I find that on the matter of credentials, Ore_Ele\\'s word heavily outweighs my opponent\\'s, given that he has been on the website for a longer amount of time than my opponent (2), and has seen the spreadsheet of every debate, lending him the basis and experience to make such explanations. This is a \"my word versus his word\" situation since neither of us have a database of statistics to refer to. So I suggest readers follow my word given the greater credibility of my source.   With that said, the refutation stands that my opponent offered faulty and deceptive statistics.   4.   Conduct  As we recall, I said that many newcomers instigate debates with faulty resolutions, hence making contenders appear to win more often. I provided examples to support this. This was one of those examples. Read its resolution:   http://www.debate.org...  This is my opponents reply to my source:  \"  1st as an aside I am appalled at the conduct in the debate quoted in source #1. Taking advantage of some kid from India\\'s lack of perfect English is wrong and a practice that should be stooped on ddo, it is unwelcoming and unfair send the guy a message, help him, as you commendably did in #2, but at the very least don\\'t take advantage.  \"   Con\\'s fallacious attempt to incriminate a worthy example goes without merit. It was a faulty resolution, so I used it as an example to show the prevalence of new-comer based faulty resolutions. I\\'m not sure if this is an attempt to gain the conduct point, but regardless, this accusation is vacuous and devoid of reason.   5.   My opponent\\'s last few examples  Readers, notice that my opponent\\'s last 3 examples were debates that HE lost. He tried to use those debates to show the contender \"advantage.\"   1. Being that those debates include my opponent, truthseeker, of course he would feel that he should have won them.   2. If you skim through those debates he provided, you will find that truthseeker\\'s opponents provided superior arguments, hence justly lending them victory.   3. These debate examples are without warrant.   In Conclusion  Back to relevance. Last word advantage does not exist unless an unskilled debator or unfair voter MAKES it an advantage.   A voter can be influenced by anything, if he allows it. He could be influenced by whoever spoke first. He could be influenced by who ever wrote more. He could be influenced by whoever took the position of con, and vice versa. He could be influenced by his own stance on the debate topic. This does not mean that the system must infinitely contort itself to counter these obstacles of judgement. It is the voter that must get past such distractions and vote fairly. If he cannot do that, then he is unfair and to blame. The system did not create the unfairness, the voter did.  The debate system of DDO, in its allowing the contender to speak last (since SOMEONE must inevitably speak last, and both debators need equal speech), is fair.   Vote Pro  . Thank you.

Round one:   Acceptance only  Round two:   Arguments  Round three:   Argument and Rebuttals  Round four:   Rebuttals  No semantics ', 'I thank my opponent for accepting this debate, and wish him good luck.   Definitions:  Govern   -    to control, direct, or strongly influence the actions and conduct of...   to exercise continuous sovereign authority over. [1]   Argument 1: Power necessitates check and balance  My first argument will center around this syllogism:  P1: Corporations have power   P2: Whatever has power, needs to be checked in some way.  C: Corporations need to be checked   P1 - Corporations have power        Modern society is heavily dependent on the information, services, and products that corporations provide us with. For example, General Electric ranks second on the most powerful corporation in the world. Existing since the startof the 20th century, it has a virtual monopoly on electrical services [2] [3]. Google, buying and owning some of the most famous and successful names in the online world, such as Youtube, has tremendous influence on the internet [4]. We have powerful Banking corporations in which we entrust our money. We have corporations from MSNBC to FOX, CNN, New York Times, Time Magazine, all to which we are reliant for accurate information, and transitively suseptible to deceit. We have business empires like Wal-Mart from which we buy our food, and multinational giants like McDonalds that serve us food. We cannot even acquire clean water without referring to water companies, waterfilter brands, and bottled water providers like Poland Spring.   In short, it is evident that the lives of what will be referred to as \"the general public\" or GP, is under an implicit control by big business.             \"  Corporations are able to reinforce their influence over the global economy by spending vast sums of money affecting political decisions, and public opinion. This level and type of corporate activity is ultimately to the detriment of democracy, society and the environment  \" [5]             They have the power and discretion over the GP\\'s access to basic necessities like food and water. They have the power and discretion to limit as they wish the GP\\'s knowledge. They have the power to control the GP\\'s money, health, and opportunity at success. That said, I cannot see how anyone could deny that a massive margin of power is shifted in the hands of the corporate world.   P2: Whatever has power, needs to be checked in some way     It could be said that the corporate world is a pseudo-government with the power to govern. Under the definition I put up earlier, this claim would be accurate. The statute assumed by Consent Theory is that any kind of government derives its powers from the consent of the governed [6]. If a wide array of corporations are to implicitly coerce the general public, they lack the right to do so. As such, the government, the rightful authority, should excercise it\\'s own power to mitigate the reach of business.   Ultimately, neither McDonalds, nor Google, nor Wal-Mart, or any other axis of economic power have the consent of the GP to be so powerful and domineering in their lives. They are unauthorized authorities.  C: Corporations need to be checked  The final conclusion follows that the Government is given the power to govern the lives of the people, but nothing at no point in the history of intelligent human interaction has given businesses the power to do the same. As such, the rightful law ought to prevent any other societal structure from reaching its own level of influence without due consent.   Argument 2: The Lockean Proviso and the necessity to enforce it  As Locke wrote:  \"  Nor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still enough and as good left, and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in effect, there was never the less left for others because of his enclosure for himself. For he that leaves as much as another can make use of does as good as take nothing at all. Nobody could think himself injured by the drinking of another man, though he took a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst. And the case of land and water, where there is enough of both, is perfectly the same.  \"  —Second Treatise of Government, Chapter V, paragraph 33 [7].   It essentially states that the Earth and its resources are commonly owned among man, so the acquisition of any of it is only permissible if enough is left and as good is left for others.   Businesses that sell products essentially plunder the raw materials from the Earth. However, to restrict the sale of those items, discriminate against consumer minorities, or make the prices unreasonably high would violate the Lockean Proviso, as it neither leaves enough nor as good of those materials for others. Businesses have claimed a monopoly on many of the natural resources and materials of the world, and the only provision preventing this action from being a moral atrocity (theft in the making), is the addition that these materials are in turn made accessible to the public. The corporate world unchecked in the playground of free market is given the option to be moral or immoral with its products, a condition of choice that is unacceptable in a free and fair society.  Government is endowed with the authority and obligation to protect the people from harm, exploitation, and threats to liberty. In this sense, the government must be the enforcer of the Lockean Proviso, ensuring that the monopolies taken on these materials don\\'t fall at the expense of the common man.   Conclusion  It is not my intention to falsely protray business as evil, rather, I want to show economic anarchy to be against the wellbeing of the general public. Corporations stand as creations of power and influence sometimes equal to that of government itself, and with power comes the necessity of check and balance, and with the creation of private property and monopoly of raw materials, comes a necessity to ensure that the public is not left disadvantaged. As such, regulation is needed to secure liberty and justice for the people.   I\\'ll end here for  the meanwhile and await my opponent\\'s counter arguments.

Introduction  Let it be clear that my opponent has the burden of proving or at least showing substantial evidence that the results of the election of 2008 were based primarily on race. I have the burden of proving it was not. I will approach this issue by providing more powerful factors to the contrary.     Sarah Palin: A Damaging Vice President  My opponent claims that Obama won primarily because of his race, but McCain was actually leading in the polls until he made a few political blunders! What, did the country not notice Obama was Black until midway through the election?   \"  In the excitement and decisiveness of Barack Obama\\'s victory, we forget that in the first weeks of September, John McCain was actually ahead....  Palin was a mistake (\"near suicidal,\" I wrote on the day of her selection) because she completely undercut McCain\\'s principal case against Obama: his inexperience and unreadiness to lead. And her nomination not only intellectually undermined the readiness argument. It changed the election dynamic by shifting attention, for days on end, to Palin\\'s preparedness, fitness and experience - and away from Obama\\'s.  \" (1)  McCain had announced His Vice Presidential choice around August - September 2008. If you look at the following graph, we see that McCain sharply falls in the polls right after that.        (2)   Its clear that Palin was damaging to the McCain ticket not only through her inexperience and anonymity, but the media\\'s portrayal of her as a ridiculous politician and a laughing stock. One could surmise that her addition to the race secured Obama the victory. Obviously this had an impact on McCain\\'s chances and transitively Obama\\'s. The election was also relatively close until that August - September period that put an end to the McCain campaign. To blame the resulting victory of Obama on his race ignores this factor that so clearly and suddenly diminished the Republican Party\\'s polling. In short, Sarah Palin had more to do with Obama\\'s election than his race, so the fact that he is Black could not be the primary reason.     Party Shift in Dissatisfaction   It is a well-known occurrence in American democracy that the nation tends to switch parties when a president has become thoroughly unpopular with the public. The sentiment follows that electing a president of the same party would be a continuation of those undesirable policies.   Shifts in history  Union crisis election (1860)      James Buchanan had failed to settle the issue of slavery and outright supported the Dred Scott decision (3).    his actions and inactions as president lead to the secession of South Carolina and the rest of the South.    PARTY SWITCH because of unpopularity of president.      Return to normalcy election (1920)      wartime expansion of the government    suppression of free speech    war fatigue left the U.S in need of greater isolationism. Woodrow was fervently campaigning for the League of Nations which, considering the isolationist sentiment, drove voters away from Wilson and toward Republicans who bitterly opposed the League (4).    As such, Harding ran on a \"return to normalcy\" and secured himself victory.    PARTY SWITCH because of unpopularity of president.      Great Depression election (1932)      Stock Market Crash of 1929    the Banking Crisis -- Herbert Hoover continued to assure the nation that all was well with the economy.    By 1933, Unemployment reached over 25% just as FDR entered the White House (5).    Prohibition    PARTY SWITCH because of unpopularity of president.      Great Recession election (2008)      Unemployment at 7.3% (6)    Foreclosures, Housing crisis    Great Recession    George W. Bush approval rating of 22% (7)    PARTY SWITCH because of unpopularity of president.      I\\'ve proved that switching parties because of a very unpopular president is a recurring pattern in American election cycles, so I see no reason why that would be inapplicable in the election of 2008. It seems rather unlikely that after 8 years of Republican president George Walker Bush and a historically low approval rating of 22% the nation would proceed to vote for ANOTHER Republican president. As a matter of fact, the nation has NEVER voted for the party of an unpopular president in the following election.   This fact shows that the failure of Bush had a lot to do with the ensuing election of the Democrat Obama, not his race.   Is Obama the first minority to Run for President?   With no arguments as of yet from my opponent, I can only assume that he feels that the country wanted to elect Obama to prove that \"we are not racist,\" or simply because we were immersed by the excitement of a minority president. However, this presumption is inconsistent with the history of our voting from 1960 to 2008.   The following African Americans ran for president and failed (8):  1. Shirley Chisholm (1972)  2. Jesse Jackson (1984 & 1988)  3. Lenora Fulani (1988)  4. Carol Moseley Braun (2004)  5. Alan Keyes (1996 & 2000)  6. Al Sharpton (2004)  7. Barack Obama (2004)  If America was so eager to elect a minority then why did all these African American candidates lose at the nomination level? Obama ran in 2004 and lost to Kerry. Why was this racial favoritism somehow absent? The burden of proof rests at Pro\\'s end.   If my opponent argues that those periods in history did not have the same eagerness for a minority president, then he\\'d need to explain why Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic nomination of 2008. In-before, we preferred African Americans to Women? My opponent\\'s stance is clearly one on unstable grounds if any at all.   Oration: the moto of Hope and Change   One\\'s ability to inspire and persuade is wholly contingent on his oratory skill. Like Martin Luther King was able to energize the Civil Rights Movement with his historic Marin Luther King speech, Obama was able to sway a considerable amount of voters with his speech.   \"  Public speaking can be a powerful tool to use for purposes such as motivation, influence, persuasion, informing, translation, or simply entertaining. A confident speaker is more likely to use this as excitement and create effective speech thus increasing their overall ethos  .\" (9)  It is widely acknowledged that Obama spoke with a conviction and oratory power that left thousands spellbound.   \"  Barack Obama\\'s message of change has been resonating with more and more voters, even converting some Republicans into Obama-cans. His victory speeches after the primaries have been downloaded thousands   of times from YouTube. Some say that when it comes to speeches, he ranks right up there with John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.  \" (10)   Now, this is just another of the innumerable factors that helped him, but even his oratory skill has more bearing in the election\\'s results than race.  Conclusion  There are a variety of reasons the United States has voted a certain way in certain elections. It ultimately boils down to a balance of crises, message, mood, and options, a complex balance that cannot be easily dichotomized into a charge as simplistic as race. To contend that Obama won PRIMARILY because he was Black tosses ALL these factors I listed as irrelevant. So, I will leave it to you voters to determine how relevant these factors are in comparison to race, and determine how realistic it is to blame the election of 2008 on Obama\\'s ethnicity.   I\\'ll end here for now and await my opponent\\'s response.

Round 1: Acceptance  Round 4: Rebuttals only  Standard debate rules apply. ', 'I thank randolph7 for accepting this debate.   Deserved:  \"to have earned or be worthy of something\" (1)   The Targets of the Nobel Peace Prize   As the Nobel Prize was created by Alfred Nobel in 1901, this is his explanation for who and under what situation the Nobel Peace Prize (NPP) in particular is deserved. He says:  \"  The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: /- - -/ one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.  \" (2)   Therefore, it is not a part of the criteria that the work be done through the course of a lifetime. It is rather the criteria that the person awarded have done \"the most   or   the best work\" for friendly and peaceful relations among nations, or the reduction of armies and promotion of institutions of peace.  The debate henceforth would need to adhere to the authority of Nobel\\'s criteria as the basis of justification or invalidity. Did Obama do the most or the best work for friendly international relations, or for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the promotion of institutions of peace?   What did Obama accomplish prior to earning the award  The following is a derived list of Obama\\'s activities:     January 21: Obama met with the ambassador to Iraq, commander in Iraq, and regional commander to receive a complete briefing on the war.        January 22: Obama ordered the closure of the   Guantanamo Bay   detention center.        January 22: Obama signed an executive order explicitly prohibiting the use of  torture   and ordering all U.S. forces to obey the Army Field Manual. He also ordered a review of the case of Ali Saleh al-Marri, a detainee held on a Naval brig in South Carolina.    January 23: Obama rescinded the   Mexico City policy  , which had prevented nongovernmental organizations from receiving government funding if they supplied family planning assistance or abortions abroad.    January 26: Obama announced his appointing of Todd Stern to the new position of  special envoy for climate change   -- recognizing the environment as a pressing foreign-policy concern(3)    Obama\\'s speech in Prague to the denouncement of Nuclear weapons and the reduction and abolition thereof. (4)         “I think it’s extremely well deserved. … I think it will take some time before people put together all the different moves that linked his speech at the U.N. on the abolishing of nuclear weapons, his shift on the missile defense program in Eastern Europe and the movement of Russia to joining the international consensus that confronted Iran to abide by the nonproliferation treaty.” — Former Vice President   Al Gore  .\"   (5)  Referring back to the criteria of the award, we see that in Obama\\'s image and campaign for a world without nuclear weapons, the closing of Guantanamo Bay, and the explicit prohibition of torture, which had been compromised in the Bush regime, he is qualified under the \"promotion of peace congresses.\" We also see that in Obama\\'s diplomatic confrontation of foreign and previously shunned regimes, he is qualified under \"fraternity between nations.\"   \"  A central element of Barack Obama\\'s plan to change American foreign policy is his intention, upon becoming president, to meet with foreign leaders of extremist regimes -- the type of rogue-state dictators that George W. Bush has generally shunned during his time as president.\"   (6)  What other presidents have won the Award and Why?  In order to better understand how Obama fits in to deserve the award, we must look at what other presidents have done to deserve the award, and compare and contrast.   The following is a list of previous presidents who have receievd the Peace Prize award, and why:       Teddy Roosevelt won it in 1905 for helping to end the Russo-Japanese War.     Woodrow Wilson won it in 1919 after pushing to join the League of Nations.     Jimmy Carter won it in 2002 (not while he was elected in office) for humanitarian efforts. (7)       Take Woodrow Wilson\\'s reason for winning, he simply pushed to join the League of Nations. This was a tremendous step under the criteria of \"fraternity between nations.\" Now take Obama\\'s new approach to foreign governments, combine that with his strong presidential advocation of nuclear weapon abolition. They both exist on the basis of mere \"promotion\" hopefully translating into action. It is often the misconception when visualizing the Nobel Peace Prize that the winners do something spontaneously heroic or lifelong and valiant. While that is the case for some, it is not the case for all.   Someone in as pressured, influential and powerful a position as the president of the U.S actively and fervently campaigning for an idealistic goal in and of itself is a significant step in more peaceful times. This is not to be distorted that all that is required to win is simply to have power, and say something about world peace, no, rather it is to have power and do something, whether it is physical action or simply relentless campaign and effort for greater strides in a more peaceful world and more peaceful relations among nations like in Roosevelt\\'s case. Obama has proved to fall under this requirement, and has proved to deserve the Nobel peace Prize, whether or not even he himself thinks so.     I\\'ll rest my argument momentarily on that point. I eagerly await my opponent\\'s response.

I will begin by refuting pro\\'s arguments and then providing my own proof as to why PAS should be illegal.   *****  REFUTATIONS  *****  1.   \"  A physician’s duty to his/her patients is simple: to relieve (as much as possible) his/her patient’s suffering, as well as preserve the dignity of said patient [1].    If a person with a terminal and painful illness is barely mobile, cannot feed his/herself, but can request to be assisted in suicide by a physician, and the physician refuses due to it being unlawful, then his/her duty isn’t being met. The patient is clearly suffering to some capacity (even with pain medication, psychological anguish is present), as well as being robbed of his/her dignity, having to lie in a bed, as others must do things for him/her.  \"  While derived from a source, I respectfully disagree with my opponent\\'s interpretation of a physicians duty. A physician\\'s duty is neither to relieve as much suffering as possible or preserve the dignity of the patient. A physician\\'s ultimate duty is to prevent death through curing or retarding the progression of ailments. That is the first and foremost reason for the medical system.   WHY?:  1. This is the historical and universal hippocratic oath of all medical professionals:   a. derived from the classical hipporatic oath \"  ...I will neither give a deadly drug to anyone if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect...  \" [1]    b. derived from the modern hippocratic oath \"  I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism  .\" [2] Therapeutic nihilism is the belief that an ailment cannot be cured. Hence, it is implied that the oath taken by all physicians and the duty to that effect is to always try to cure one\\'s patient. The option of killing the patient is contrary to this sworn oath.   Hence, I would like the readers to extract from these excerpts the point:    A physician\\'s ultimate duty is to prevent death through curing or retarding the progression of ailments. They must always try and try again to cure the ailment. Assisting the death of a patient would infringe upon that duty and obligation.     2.   \"  Any person, whether a medical patient or not, owns his/her body, as well as life. Therefore, he/she also has the right to do with his/her body and life as he/she fits  \"  This point does not have much relevance or merit in this particular debate. Pro can use this contention in a debate regarding suicide legality. However, this debate is about physicians, the one\\'s we trust most to help us live, assisting suicide. Since the patients are not making the absolute individual desicion and execution of ending their own life, it is done by someone else, pro\\'s point that is quoted above has no relevance. It only applies to those who kill themselves independently. It is a different atmosphere when a physician helps this act.   3.   \"  Whatever way one looks at it, dying costs money. In fact, a person in Miami will be spending around $23,000 on medical bills in the last six months of his/her life [2]. This cost is for dying without the use of PAS. However, a person, using PAS, would only spend approximately $10,000 (in 1995 dollars) on medical bills [3]. I’d like you to think about that. If a person chooses to have a PAS, this would mean that his/her surviving relatives would have about $13,000 that they didn’t before to put toward a funeral (a traditional funeral ranges from $7,000 to over $10,000 [4]), or other debts that may need to be paid.  Once more, I’d like to go back to my hypothetical. Let’s say that this patient who wishes to have a PAS, may have un-wealthy relatives, or he/she may be un-wealthy. Not only is he/she suffering, but he/she is also paying quite a bit of medical bills to be kept alive, especially when he/she doesn’t wish to be in the first place. So, given the opportunity to choose, not only would he/he be relieving his/herself of suffering, but also saving money for his/her relatives or beneficiaries as well.  \"  My opponent is basically saying that physician assisted suicide should be legal because it saves the families\\' money. I will not argue against the fact that PAS could save families money on funerals, but I will point out that this is only one practical benefit. I will prove in the following contentions that the moral and practical drawbacks heavily outweigh this one practical benefit. It will hence become my proof that if it is, on the grand scale, both impractical and immoral to legalize PAS, then it should not be legal.   *****  PROOF OF MY POSITION  *****  Physician Assisted Suicide is Immoral and Impractical  1. It demeans the value of a human life. Death, in this modern age, is sometimes taken lightly by those who do not fully understand its impact on their beings, life, and the people around them. It is the ultimate duty of a physician to protect and defend life. Death cannot be used as a means of escape or an easier option for a physician than working vigorously to cure and help the patient.   \"   ...human life means something...To stomp out a life because it\\'s not convenient or it\\'s expensive demeans that value  .  \" [3]  2. Physicians are not always correct and can make mistakes or simply do immoral things. In such events, a life can be lost through PAS when such was unnecessary. Legalizing PAS opens the door to such accidents. At an unfortunately consistent rate, doctors misdiagnose their patients. Who\\'s to say that a man or woman won\\'t kill themselves once they mistakenly hear they have cancer? We cannot allow such accidents to even have this slim gateway of possibility. A human life is too dear to risk the possibility of such tragic occurrences ESPECIALLY since that risk isn\\'t critically necessary. Physicians can also be immoral, they may tell their patients that they will die painfully and prompt them to accept PAS when that is not necessary. We cannot allow these possibilities to come to fruition. The best way to ensure this is to keep PAS illegal.  3. The government and ensurance companies could also use PAS for immoral purposes. They could pressure physicians to suggest PAS because it would be less expensive and more efficient, when there other are options for the patient. My opponent himself made it a point to outline the financial benefit of suicide. It is a dangerous possibility that companies and the government could manipulate this financial gain for themselves. Keeping PAS illegal would, for the most part, nullify this threat.   4. My opponent said, \"  provided that his/her decision hasn’t been influenced by anything other than his/her own personal judgment  \"  Pain is a form of influence. Pain and pressure can influence people to do things that they may not really want. When a patient is under the influence of suffering and pain, his mind becomes fixated on alleviating that pain at all costs. It is not fair to the patient to readily accept his decisions while under such pressure. It is only the decisions made under more placid conditions that truly reflect the genuine desires of people.   Hypothetical situation: A man/woman with cancer will probably experience tremendous pain. He/she may also have a family to take care of. With PAS as an open option, while the patient is not thinking clearly and just wants to feel at ease, he may abandon whatever children or family he/she has waiting at home and choose suicide. The man/woman will have died in vain, because had that pain not clouded his/her judgement, he/she may have chosen to live. Now you have an unnecessary death, and a heartbroken family.   Now my opponent could ammend his resolution to say that PAS should be legal when the patient is not influenced by pain, but that would not make sense either. If a patient is not experiencing pain, then out of respect for the value of a human life, and a physician\\'s oath, there would be no justification for administering PAS.  SOURCES  *read comments ', 'The Hippocratic Oath  1.   \"  The sad truth is though, that by Con\\'s definition of therapeutic nihilism, physicians are therapeutically nihilistic already in some cases To find an example, one need only to look at a terminal illness. A terminal illness is defined by the medical dictionary as   \"an advanced stage of a disease with an unfavorable prognosis and no known cure,\"   [2]. In other words, a disease which will most likely, if not certainly, end the life of a patient, even with treatment of symptoms. The very fact that diseases are considered terminal by physicians indicates that there already is therapeutic nihilism  \"   My opponent attempts to use the concept of a terminal illness to show the presence of therapeutic nihilism, but he does so under false pretenses. A terminal illness being described as such does not imply that the physician will not attempt to cure or retard the ailment. For example. Cancer is a terminal illness. However, processes such as Chemotherapy, Radiation therapy, and immunotherapy are used constantly, Over and over again to cure or help the patient. Never is it accepted for the physician to give up. Therefore, my opponent\\'s assertion that therapeutic nihilism is already accepted in the medical community is factually unsound.  What does this all mean?  a. Well, I proved earlier that PAS implies therapeutic nihilism   b. and the modern oath is against therapeutic nihilism  c. What better describes a physician\\'s duty than the oath he takes upon entering his profession?  d. Therefore, PAS is against the duty of a physician....and so we have arrived at my first contention.    2.   \"  To even further dismantle Con’s argument of the Hippocratic Oath, sources indicate that, even during the days of Hippocrates, PAS’s, as well as euthanasia (but that’s a different matter), were actually quite commonly performed, as well as recommended, by physicians [3]. So, again, I raise the question: if PAS’s were administered even when the Oath was created, then why should modern-day PAS’s, be any exception?  \"  I guess the hippocrates were hypocrites, but that does not nullify the validity of the oath still used and honored by doctors worldwide to this day. I will also use this as an opportunity to negate. Pro stated that the oaths have been tweaked. That is false, people have developed opinions for or against the oaths, but they still stand absolutely unchanged.   3.   \"  One final point I’d like to make involves the actual core value of the Hippocratic Oath. The main value that the Oath is trying to uphold is for physicians to not do any harm (hence the original prohibition of abortion/surgery.) The definition of harm as a noun is “physical injury or mental damage; hurt,” [4]. But the big question is, isn’t forcing a person to live with a terminal illness against their wishes, and in physical and mental pain, the definition of harm, and thus doing harm?  \"  That in and of itself is a distortion of the intention of the oaths. My opponent uses the word \"forces\" when nothing is forced. The patient is not forced to live with it, he can kill himself independently, again, suicide legality is a whole different debate. All that I urge and argue for is that a physician should not be involved in the act of ending his patient\\'s life.   REFUTATIONS     1.   \"   Here, Con\\'s biggest contention is that Death shouldn\\'t be an escape or easy option for a physician to not treat his patient. Again, I feel with this contention clarification is in order. In Oregon, (the only US state with PAS) the law requires doctors to inform the requestee of other options, such as a hospice, or palliative care, and that they are in fact possible alternatives [6]. So, I therefore say that the argument of a physician taking an easy way out is thus negated.  \"  Who is to enforce this law, and who will know if the patient was properly informed of all possible alternatives? No one. Whether or not the law says so, the physician could neglect to mention options or make frivilous mistakes in information that could lead to disasterous results. Now I know my argument works on a \"what if\" basis, but when dealing with human lives we nust consider the worst and gauge the risk. Pro\\'s contentions seem to hold value only under a perfect, strictly law abiding medical system, and that alone is unrealistic. It is the \"what ifs\", the tangent scenarios, and the variables that make PAS so risky and implausible. The matter of life and death is one without room for such uncertainty.   2.   \"  Here, Con asserts that government or insurance companies would pressure physicians to suggest PAS. However, the fact remains that a PAS is requested,   not suggested.     And even when it is requested, a physician must, as I pointed out earlier, present alternatives and make it clear that they are feasible. So, the danger that Con has presented is not as dangerous as he would make it out to be.  \"  Again I will point out the unfortunate naivety of Pro\\'s logic. His points work only under a perfect, law abiding medical system, but such does not exist. Insurance companies and the government have much to gain from PAS. They save money, quite a lot of money. Regardless of law, legalization of PAS all over the country will open the doors to very disturbing scenarios and deviousness from the corporate world.   I will introduce one more final contention as to why PAS should be illegal:  1. It will deplete our faith and trust in modern medicine and medical knowledge. The effort and drive to keep people alive (AS IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROFESSION)  will die as patients increasingly give up on the trustworthiness and reliability of our medicine and physicians\\' ability to discover, invent, and cure for the better of humanity. Once death becomes an option, people lose faith and hope. Dying becomes a fall-back. We won\\'t have as many people crusading for solutions, for cures, the tunnel to peace (death) would become an inviting option for many. Once diagnosed with cancer, how many people would simply end their lives when, who knows, a cure could be the breaking news of the following day. I am well aware that my argument comes across as emotive and idealistic, but the topic of life and death is emotive by nature, so it cannot be met with strictly practical eyes.   I do not argue, saying that we must force patients to stay alive, I argue that the medical field must NEVER condone or support death, much less assist it. If we are to maintain the integrity of this field, the hope, the tenacity, and the public trust in medical professionals, the law must remain as it is. Let those who want to give up, give up by themselves, the medical field must not join in. The medical field must always have the attitude of ascension, and tirelessly aiming towards solutions, treatments, and cures. THIS was the real attitute of the modern hippocratic oath. ', 'Closing Rebuttals  1. \"  Here, Con contradicts himself in his thinking. While he does agree that \"the hippocrates were hypocrites,\"he also states that this does not detract from the value of the modern Hippocratic Oath. The problem with this is that he immediately counters another argument of mine by saying that the Oath is unchanged. So, one could say that, by proxy, the modern Oath\\'s value is detracted from, seeing as how the previous Oath was ignored, and the modern Oath is in effect, the original.  \"  There seems to be a lack of connections in pro\\'s rebuttal. What gives the oath it\\'s value, as far as modern times are concerned, is whether or not it is acknowledged, followed, and respected by a decent amount of doctors today. I cited the classical hipporcatic oath because it is indeed respected and followed by many doctors today. So the classical hippocratic oath still stands as a credible source of evidense against PAS. The modern Hippocratic oath is what all physicians recite upon graduation, and that too, as I showed had implications against PAS such as the denouncement of therapeutic nihilism. I do not see the detraction in value of either oath that my opponent is imagining, nor do I see the contradiction he speaks of.   2. \"   As well, I\\'d also like to point out another flaw. One of Con\\'s contentions is that PAS\\'s should stay illegal because that would then allow a physician to break his/her Oath. This is why we\\'ve been debating this issue of the Oath in particular so heavily. However, if what Con has stated is true, and that the modern Oath remains effectively unchanged, then his overall contention that PAS violates the Oath is proved false. Abortion and surgery, two things which I argued earlier were   directly   not allowed according to the Oath, are both legal across the US. Of course, I\\'m not suggesting the two-wrongs-make-a-right argument, but what I am suggesting is that Con\\'s argument using the Hippocratic Oath can be considered null and void.  \"  It appears that my opponent is confused between the classical oath and the modern oath. Again, I cited the classical oath simply for additional support, it is the modern oath this is in full effect for all modern physicians. The modern oath does not go against abortion or surgery, only the classical does, so pro\\'s claims are false. His whole point here was that the modern oath supposedly goes against two practices that are widely accepted, so that nullifies the credibility of the oath. This may be so for the classical oath which is not enforced, even though many doctors still adhere to it, but it is not so for the modern oath, where therapeutic nihilism, and transitively PAS is denounced. THEREFORE, without getting the readers into further semantics, the modern oath still stands, unnegated, unchanged, and just as credible as ever. So my point that the modern oath is credible evidence against PAS still stands as well.  4. \"  Con declares that I am distorting the Oath here, as well as saying that \"nothing is forced. The patient is not forced to live with it, he can kill himself independently, again, suicide legality is a whole different debate.\"This is not entirely true. People that generally request PAS\\'s either aren\\'t able to commit suicide in the conventional manners, being bedbound and terminally ill, or, to turn Con\\'s source from round 2 into my own, they may commit suicide in much more grisly, painful, undignified, and traumatic ways\"  Pro asserts that just because patients may kill themselves in more painful and undignified ways, it becomes the obligation of the physician to provide a better method of death. This argument is logically unsound. It is like saying that just because a depressed individual experiencing mental and emotional pain wants to jump off a bridge, his doctor must give him lethal drugs to make the death less painful. The objective is to have patients live healthy, happy lives. If the patient wants to kill themselves, the physician has no obligation, and in fact has a duty AGAINST assisting that act. If the patient is bedridden and is hell-bent on killing him/herself, the hopsital can simply discharge him/her to his/her family. Physician help is so contradictory to the intents of this profession.     5. I mentioned the depletion of faith in the medical field that PAS would bring. On the practical level, this isn\\'t much of an argument, but on the level of psychological implications, it is certainly something to consider. Modern medicine has been sort of a comforting hope that maybe all is not lost when diagnosed with rare or lethal diseases. Having death off the table as an option leaves the trust alive and faith a bit stronger, but when stared with such a simple (even though it is not easy) final option, the drive and the faith is weakened. Death may be a consideration for some patients, but should not be for the profession. PAS must not be granted U.S legality, lest the \"there is always another way\" attitude of the medical community die in the process.   I ask the readers to consider the effects of PAS.  1. Opens the gate to many unnecessary deaths  2. Opens the gate to tremendous corporate and governmental corruption  3. Contradicts both the sworn modern oath and the respected classical oath of Physicians   4. Weakens the drive and attitude of ascention in the medical field  5. Demeans the value of lives  I will let the voters judge for themselves whether these important side-effects outweigh the gain. I will, once again, thank DetectableNinja for creating and executing a very challenging and educational debate.  Thank you all for reading. ', 'My initial position is that a state has no right to secede from the Union of the United States. I will begin by defining the key phrases being used.   Secede: \"to withdraw from an organization (as a religious communion or political party or federation)\" In this case, secession is the withdrawal from a federation as a separate and sovereign nation.   Right: \"Something that is due to a person or governmental body by law, tradition, or nature\"   My argument shall be centered around three contentions:     1.   When the original colonies ratified the Constitution, when the territories agreed to enter the Union, when The Republic of Texas asked to join the Union, and when the kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown by American missionaries, each and everyone of those regions immediately ceded their land, jurisdiction, and status as a separate governing entity to the federal government of the United States (with respect to their limited governing powers as states). Hence, the act of secession is thievery of citizens, land, and jurisdiction from federal government of the U.S.    * The 1st reason why ratification and entry to the union gave up the state\\'s right to leave is that we are one unified nation, not a conglomerate of 50 pieces weakly bonded together to form the fuzzy appearance of a country. A state cannot just detach itself from this Union when it disagrees with the decisions of the national government.     - Instead, if a state disagrees, our government is structured in such a way   that its voice and complaints can force change.    - Secession would be unnecessary and would take the Union very lightly.    * The federal government BOUGHT the region of the Louisiana purchase. The federal government FOUGHT AND WON the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah, with parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming. The federal government signed the agreement that gave us the Oregon territory. It was the federal government who carved out the states. Therefore, It is the federal government, not California, or New Jersey or Minnesota etc., that owns the land. A state cannot take that land, jurisdiction and citizens away from the federal government. Hence it is thievery.   2.   If one imagines an environment in which the U.S allowed states to leave peacefully, there are a few issues that he would come across.   * One, a state would simply secede whenever it truly, deeply disliked what the federal government was doing, which is a practically inevitable event. The U.S, in effect, would have broken apart within these last 2 centuries.    *Two, the federal government, out of concern that the U.S shall be no more, would be very meek about exercising its due authority over the states (granted that authority is constitutional). The federal government would find itself in the same situation that the Articles of Confederation created: very powerless.    - After all, the federal government has to be able to protect it\\'s citizens,    even if it conflicts with the interests of the states.   3.   The spirit of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence do allude to the peoples right to form a revolution and create a new government, should they be unsatisfied with the current administration,  BUT   Both documents also allude to the necessary provisions under which such a revolution would be morally sanctioned, and also allude to the fact that regardless of reasoning, such an act shall be high treason. I will provide the instances of these allusions after con makes his opening argument.   I look forward to an interesting debate. Good Luck. ', 'Before I continue with my argument, I would like to address three matters in which my opponent and I do not agree.   1.   \"For the purposes of this debate I will be claiming a right to secession that is derived from natural law.\"    \"That being said, my arguments against the affirmative will be using his   legal framework,   proving why I win under either framework.\"   My framework does not lean towards the question of a legal right to secession, as that continues to be a very difficult debate to this day. Rather I am arguing for the position that a state, under natural law, does not have a moral right to secede. My first contention is an example. I stated that secession was thievery, which is not morally sanctioned, hence not a moral right. So, I would like for us to agree that I am arguing for the position that secession is not a moral right.   2.   Furthermore, con\\'s supporting examples are addressed towards \"THE PEOPLE\" not \"THE STATE\". Hence I would like for us to agree that there IS a difference between \"the people,\" and \"the state\". What that difference may be, can be debated, but I would like us to agree that a difference exists. Therefore, if con agrees that a difference exists, he cannot use examples addressed towards the rights of \"the people\" to support his argument for the rights of \"the state\".  3.   \" Federalism is the system of shared powers between the state and federal governments. My opponent is arguing under a misconception. States do not give up their sovereignty when joining the Union, but rather submit to a greater sovereign. This does not imply the slavery of states\"   This particular argument is highly dependent on the word \"join.\" While I do agree with con\\'s definition of federalism, and that the U.S is a federation, I still hold that the implications and abilities as members of a federation differ between the bodies that JOINED said federation, and the ones that were already a part of it. In the case of the United States, the only states that literally JOINED the union are the 13 original colonies, Texas, and Hawaii, the other states were purchased or won in war, hence ,making them the property of the federal government. Since con\\'s argument applies only to the states that JOINED the union, henceforth, the debate is geared towards why that minority of states that actually joined the union does or does not have the moral right to leave. So, I would like us to agree that the states that were conquered and purchased territories are the property of the federal government and should they choose to secede, will be STEALING from the federal government, and agree that you, as con, can only argue for the states that JOINED the union.   That being said, I have a separate set of reasons that I touched on in round 1, why the minority of states that joined the union STILL do not have a moral right to secede. However I see no point in stating them until I have an answer on the previous provisions from con. Should con disagree with any or all of the above provisions, they will become subject to debate, alongside the parent issue of secession. Where:  For Provision 1:  Con bears the burden of proving how my framework was geared towards secession legality,  For provision 2:   Con bears the burden of proving why \"the people\" and \"the state\" are synonymous,  For provision 3:  Con bears the burden of proving why a state that joined the union is no different from one that was bought/won and carved out by the federal government.    (1)    http://lsm.crt.state.la.us...  (2)   http://www.sonofthesouth.net... ', 'My reply to con\\'s third rebuttle will be a part of refutation 2.   1.   Given that you have accepted that my framework is under the moral right to secede, I do also accept that if you can prove a legal right to secede, then the debate is yours.  * HOWEVER, as I said, the legality of the subject has been inconclusively debated for over a century.   I would like for the reading audience to fully understand the hard facts and evidence Con must procure, should he attempt to prove a legal right to secession:  1. He must find in the Constitution, and the Constitution ONLY, where the act of secession is, LEGALLY sanctioned.    - He cannot use the provisions in the ratification documents in different states, because those where never definitively accepted by the Philedelphia Convention.   - Furthermore, the Constitution is the highest document of law in the nation. The Declaration of Independence cannot be used as evidence, if Con is to prove a LEGAL right.   2. Furthermore, the excerpt, should my opponent manage to find one, must EXPLICITLY declare secession legal, under the definition I provided earlier.   3. Moreover, con cannot make the argument that the Constitution mentions nothing about secession, so he is therefore still correct, because in legal matters, the absence of the declaration of a LEGAL right does infact mean that the LEGAL right does not exist.   4. In the event that Con cannot find, in the Constitution, where secession is legally sanctioned, he has failed to prove that the states have a legal right to secession.   With that said, con can still debate to prove any other right to secession.   2.    Con agreed that there was a physical and definitional difference between the state and the people, but stated that there was no difference between the rights held by both bodies. This leads us to a separate debate all on its own.   * The state is a governmental appendage. By the reasoning Con provided, he is simply playing on the fact that senators and representatives are elected by the state to the federal government. The U.S\\'s use of the states as a national conduit does not imply that \"the state\" and \"the people\" are one. Furthermore, by your reasoning, the national government and the people of the U.S would ALSO be one, as the president and Congress are elected BY the people, JUST LIKE ANY STATE.      * The state, being the VOICE of the people, does not MAKE the state \"the people.\" Therefore the rights contained by the people cannot be used interchangeably with the rights of the state.  -   The state   is a part of the government, an EXTENTION of the government to suit the needs of specific geographical, social, and political regions of the nation. The states, by territory and jurisdiction, are the property of the federal government, and do not have the right to leave. For the states that ENTERED the union, entrance ceded their rights to do such. This is not a club, or a close association. Unionship is the welding of a state to FORM a larger soverign, not submit to one.   -   The people   are NOT the property of the federal government, and should they be unhappy with the government, have the undeniable and uncompromisable right to petition, amass and protest, join the government, sue, or simply leave. All these actions are done by THE PEOPLE independent of THE STATE. The states were not created so it would be easier for the citizens of the country to depart. They where created as a tool to PREVENT departure through greater self government.   Once again, the state is only a conduit to the federal government: A conduit created BY the federal gov\\'t FOR the people not given TO  the people. The state is land, land that forms a large unified entity. This land does not belong to anyone who wishes to form a new country, the land belongs to the federal government of the United States. Those people who want a new nation must FIGHT the United States to take the land. Hence a state has no moral right to PEACEABLY secede. ', '\"  Let\\'s look back to my turn on his 3rd contention  . This is cleanly extended in round 2 as Provision 1 subpoint 1 ii: \" My opponent states himself   \\'the Constitution and Declaration of Independence do allude to the peoples right to form a revolution and create a new government, should they be unsatisfied with the current administration.\\'   My opponent concedes that a legal right exists for States to secede. Even if certain circumstances must be met, the right exists nonetheless.\"  1.   My oppponent is arguing in circles. I have made it a point through the course of the debate to outline the difference between THE PEOPLE and THE STATE. Yet, ignoring that very important debateable subtopic, he has quoted A statement I made earlier addressed to THE PEOPLE, to support his argument for THE STATE. He has yet to prove what makes the state and the people one, and instead has only stated the assertion that they are one, in many forms.   \" My opponent\\'s arguments simply make the claim that my own points are false without addressing the warrants of states serving as a proxy for individuals. Also extend subpoint 2 that \"The State\\'s actions are defined by the people, thus if the people express a right the State also expresses it.\"  2.   On the contrary, what you outlined from the 3rd round DOES address the warrants of your argument.   *  Your argument was that the state becomes the people, hence \"proxy\", and that it therefore holds the rights of the people.    - I addressed this matter through answering why con may believe that the state is a proxy for people. I said, the reason why con would possibly believe that the state is a proxy is because the people elect senators and representatives THROUGH the state. I presumed that it is this fact that makes con assert that the state is a proxy (since he has yet to provide his own reason why), and so I showed that the federal government has positions also voted on by the people, and by con\\'s logic, the federal government would ALSO be a proxy. Since, I think we can all conclude, the federal government is certainly not a proxy for the people, the state, TOO, has no sound justification for being looked at as a proxy.  The state, once again, is an EXTENTION of the government, but my opponent is arguing that the state is a proxy for the people, when factually it is not.   1. Hence, if the state is not a proxy to the people, then the state cannot hold the same rights as the people.   2. If the states do not hold the same rights as the people, then the \"peoples right to revolution\" cannot be justly asserted for the state, as the state is not the people  3. Therefore, the argument that natural law gives a state the moral right to secession is moot.   3.   Now, I will proceed to disprove any legal right to secession, since my opponent insists on that angle as well.  Article 4, Section 3 of the United States Constitution (1):  \"The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States\"   It is the implication and subtext of this excerpt that the territory occupied by the United States belongs to the country as a whole (\"the country as a whole\" being represented by the federal government), and no particular state individually. The limited jurisdiction of the states over the political map does not imply ownership of the land thereof.   1. THEREFORE, the land of the states by geography are subject to regulation and authority by the federal government through CONSTITUTIONAL DECREE.   2. Secession would lift this authority  3. Lifting of said authority is illegal  4. Secession is Illegal.   (1)   http://www.archives.gov... ', 'Since this is the 5th round, con and I cannot introduce any new points to the debate. So, I will use this round to summarize and explain why I have won this debate.     Part One  1. It was the burden of con to prove that \"A\" state had \"SOME\" right to secession whether it is a legal right or moral right.  2. He attempted to prove a legal right by asserting that I agreed to a legal right to secession when I did not. That was his ONLY support for why secession is legal. He stated: \"My opponent concedes that a legal right exists for States to secede. Even if certain circumstances must be met, the right exists nonetheless.\"  3. I proceeded to PROVE secession illegal through the implications of an excerpt from the Constitution:  \"1. THEREFORE, the land of the states by geography are subject to regulation and authority by the federal government through CONSTITUTIONAL DECREE.   2. Secession would lift this authority  3. Lifting of said authority is illegal  4. Secession is Illegal. \"  *   My opponent forfeited round 4, so has therefore failed to refute the above conclusion, and thus has failed to prove a legal right to secession.     Part Two  5. He attempted to prove a moral right by referring to the 1st round where I wrote that \"The Constitution and Declaration of Independence do allude to THE PEOPLES right to revolution\" But I outlined the difference between \"THE PEOPLE\" and \"THE STATE\"   The state is political and an extention of government, the people are not.   6. Con defended that the state is a proxy for the people. I countered that the state is a conduit not a proxy. Very Unsynonymous words.   \" 1. Hence, if the state is not a proxy to the people, then the state cannot hold the same rights as the people.   2. If the states do not hold the same rights as the people, then the \"peoples right to revolution\" cannot be justly asserted for the state, as the state is not the people  3. Therefore, the argument that natural law gives a state the moral right to secession is moot. \"  7.    My opponent forfeited the 4th round and hence failed to refute the above resolution. Therefore he has failed to prove a moral right to secession.         RESOLUTION  8. Since my opponent failed to prove a legal or moral right to secession for \"A\" state, I urge that he has lost the debate.  Therefore I strongly encourage a PRO vote.   I thank Mestari for a very interesting debate.

', 'I return the thanks.   Clarification  As we recall, my opponent defined \"Noah\\'s flood\" as \" An \"  event\" in history that was a world wide flood.  \" He does not define it as The event in history described in the Bible.

I made him aware of this, and he accepted it (\"  Since we are getting a literal reading of the text...  \").His references to the Bible and the Christian religion are therefore irrelevant to the resolution of the debate. I am arguing that a global flood has occurred before in History, my opponent is arguing that such has never occurred. Ergo, religious references can only be addressed under the logical fallacy of the Red Herring.   Refutation  1. \"  C1.1) Tree ring dating  Since we are getting a literal reading of the texts, we know for a fact that the flood would have occurred 2500-2300 BCE  \"  Red Herring Fallacy  ,....This time frame is a religious reference to the Bible, which states that the flood occurred 2348 BC (1), unless of course my opponent has scientific evidence that it is impossible for floods to occur outside said time frame.   2. \"  C1.2) The flood did not leave traces on the sea floor.  According to Genesis, the flood lasted for about 1 year. This should be recognizable in the sea floor due to the following:  \"  Red Herring Fallacy  .....Genesis is a reference to the Bible.   3. \"  C1.3) The polar caps are impossible if a global flood really did occur.  \"  Global Warming having occurred before, melted the polar ice caps AND flooded the globe. However, ice caps are possible today because they reformed during the most recent Ice Age.

Since we are taking a literal reading of Genesis, we are also taking a literal reading of the genealogies. Therefore, if we can prove that cultures existed before and after 2500-2300 BCE uninterrupted, we can prove that Noah\\'s flood is a myth.   The Egyptian Pyramids were built about 2560 BCE [6], apparently, the Egyptians were not affected by this \"global\" flood. Neither was Assyria [4], China [5], or Sumer.   \"  Red Herring Fallacy  .....religious and irrelevant reference to the Bible.   Global Warming (GW)     By neglecting to define the following words, my opponent has given me the liberty to do so myself.    Flood:    an expanse of water submerging land(2)  Global Flood:   Simultaneous overflow of water due to global oceanic sealevel increases, submerging at least 1 area of land on the 6 habitable continents.   My argument will be centered around the following syllogism:  1. Global Warming causes global floods (our definition of the term \"Noah\\'s flood\")   2. Global Warming has occurred before.   3. Global Floods have occurred before.  (Hence negating the resolution)   Global warming causes global floods  As GW is the increase in the world\\'s temperature(3), it will melt the polar ice caps and glaciers in the arctic and antarctic regions, causing a 60 - 100 meter rise in sealevel (4). \"  Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets also contribute to rising sea levels, threatening low-lying areas around the globe with beach erosion, coastal flooding, and contamination of freshwater supplies  \"(5) This causes flooding in at least 1 area of several continents. \"  Regions especially at risk are low-lying areas of North America, Latin America, Africa, populous coastal cities of Europe, crowded delta regions of Asia that face flood risks from both large rivers and ocean storms, and many small islands whose very existence is threatened by rising seas.  \"(6)  By my definition of global flooding, we are now seeing that global warming causes floods in the following continents.   1. North America  2. South America (Latin America)  3. Africa   4. Europe  5. Asia   \"  [Global warming in Australia will cause] damaged transportation infrastructure, and disasters, such as coastal flooding...  \"(7) Thus adding Australia to our list.   6. Australia.   As you can see, global warming causes global floods.   Global Warming has occurred before  Climate change is cyclic occurring in the form of global temperature increase (global warming) and global temperature decrease (Ice Age). \"  The idea that Global Warming is a natural cycle is well understood from paleo data covering the past 1 million years  \"(8). Global warming is the force that melts the ice from an ice age. \"  Global warming began 18,000 years ago as the earth started warming its way out of the  Pleistocene Ice Age  -- a time when much of North America, Europe, and Asia lay buried beneath great sheets of glacial ice... For the past million years the natural climate has oscillated between warm periods and ice ages  \"(9)  As you can see, GW has occurred before.   Conclusion  Having proved the primary and secondary premises of my syllogism, we have successfully arrived at the conclusion. Global warming is directly equal to global floods. The Earth cannot increase in temperature without raising sealevels and flooding the coasts of continents. Therefore, since it is a fact that Global warming has occurred before it is also a fact that global floods, or as my opponent named it, \"noah\\'s flood\" has occurred before.

His only support for the second round was highly irrelevant and proved and supported nothing:  \"  My argument as pro is tht if I were in a band and I wanted to get popular I could easily put a few extra notes in to Led Zeppelin (Stair way to heaven) and call it my own  .\"  There is no need for negation to the quote above simply because the debate has nothing to do with my opponent joining a band, nor does it involve \"Stair way to heaven.\"   Now, Pro has the burden of proof, and my responsibility is to negate. So, if he cannot fulfill his obligation to provide proof to his claim, then I win by default.   Evidence against  Steal: \"          take     something     without     permission  \"           [1]  1. The world of popular modern music is without pure originality. When one finds two pieces with the same beat, far be it from him to assume that the beat was stolen. I will name a few popular songs with the exact same beat.  a. Alicia Keys\\'s \"No One\" & Black Eyed Peas\\'s \"Where is the Love\"  b. Second example is Video 1   Having the same beat is simply not enough evidence to prove that a beat was stolen, the prevalence of   \"same-beats\" in modern music is so high, that pro would be suggesting that most artists are theives. I refer to my previous definition of steal. No where in the dictionary is steal described as \"replication by chance\".  2. Furthermore, in order for the beat to be stolen, Pro must prove first that the beat was the property of Queen in the first place. According to a source on music copyrights, it is the song in whole that is under sole ownership by the artist, not the song in part. [2] A beat is merely a part of a song, a rhythmic pattern. Having people own rhythmic patterns is unheard of. Unless \"Ice ice baby\" in WHOLE is the same or dangerously similar to \"Under Pressure\" in WHOLE: lyrics, key signature, tempo, melody and all, then nothing is stolen.   I will show you that the two songs in question have VERY different melodies and lyrics. Therefore:  a. they are not similar or the same ( in WHOLE)   B. so nothing was truely stolen. The beat is not owned.    1. proof is in Video 2 and Video 3      SOURCES   [1]     http://thesaurus.com...  [2]  http://www.copyrightauthority.com... ', 'Rebuttals     1.   \"  Please listen to the videos you have listed and listen to the bass line, they are clearly the same. The only thing different is that Vanilla Ice adds one more beat/bass. That is why I brought up joining a band and adding notes  \"  Did I argue that they were not the same? No. They are clearly the same, without doubt, but Pro\\'s resolution was not that the beat of \"Ice Ice Baby\" and \"Under pressure\" are the same. His resolution was that the beat was stolen from \"Under Pressure\". With that in mind, my opponent has yet to disprove or negate both my contentions of the \"same-beat\" prevalence, and the ownership of song in WHOLE, not in part. Therefore I extend both contentions to the third round.   2.   \"  Also as pro Alisha Keys and Black eyed peas have nothing to do with this debate  \"  I mentioned Alicia Keys and the Black eyed Peas because they both have songs with the exact same beat. (refer to Videos 1 and 2)   I admit that the debate has nothing to do with them, but I used them to show the prevalence of \"same-beats\" in modern music and give Pro an idea of the amount of artists that would be thieves under his accusation. I used it to form the point that having the same beat in modern times is commonplace and does not automatically imply that it was copied or stolen. The mention of Alicia Keys and the Black Eyed Peas, though irrelevant when isolated, returned to relevance when it formed that contention. My opponent\\'s mentioning of his joining a band led to no substantial contention or proof. Therefore, his attempt to denounce my comparison like I denounced his is without merit, given the different situations.   I hold that my opponent has failed to refute either contention from round two, so again, I extend.   1) \"Same beats\" are commonplace in modern times often by chance. My opponent, having the burden of proof, would need an argument more substantial than that to fulfill his burden.   2) A song in WHOLE is what is owned, meaning the lyrics, the key signature, the melody, and all. If a small PART of one song appears in another song, maybe a swift excerpt from the melody or in this case the beat, the ownership does not exist. Hence the beat is not \"STOLEN\" since no one owned it. If my opponent has objections to this, I would like him to explain why all artists who reuse beats do not simply   GET SUED  . The only situation under which a beat can POSSIBLY be owned is when the beat is created independently of a song and sold. The patent on \"Under Pressure\" applies to the song in WHOLE because a whole song was created and then patented. Ripping off parts of songs, unless any of those parts are specifically under patent, unfortunately, is not only legal, but widely accepted and commonplace. Hence it is not thievery, and therefore, Ice Ice Baby did not steal anything ( steal implying that the object in question was owned to begin with).

Vanilla Ice agreed to pay Queen and Bowie a settlement  \"  Something cannot be stolen if it was paid for, the negation of the resolution is within Pro\\'s \"proof\". The resolution and Pro\\'s entire debate session did not specify the technicalities.

', \"To start, my initial position is that the death penalty is not justified ever.    Justice is a form of rectification of a misdeed. Justice has its parameters however, such that in punishing a criminal, the people who enact said punishment do not become criminals themselves. Given that it is a universal and unilateral resolution of man that to kill is forbidden, I hold that even in the process of punishment, one must not kill another human being.    If we think about the conditions under which the death penalty is considered, we find crimes such as: cruel and contemptuous unrestrained homicide, mass murder, terrorism, torture, rape, and other inhuman acts of evil. When ever man reaches the highest crimes, death seems to be the justice. However, we must remember that the motive of any punishment is to ensure that the crime committed will not be repeated. Hence, if a man kills many other people, to kill that man in return, would defeat the very purpose of the justice through repeating the crime.    I hold that under any given situation, it shall always be a crime to kill. It is not within any person's right to rob the life of another human being, for that, beside torture, is the highest evil known to man.    I ask that pro define justice as he/she sees it, and explain how the death penalty is an integral part of it.    I'll leave it at that to allow pro to begin his argument.

I will present arguments in the negation of the aforementioned resolution. Should pro only refute my points without upholding his own, that would be insufficient argumentation, as it does not fulfill his burden. Having said that, I will begin my argument.   Clarafication  The implication of a (pro) secession justification argument is that the parties seceding should be allowed to secede in peace and without military intervention...for if the body in which the secession occurs is to be moral, it must not interfere with the supposed rights of the seceding entity. Since rights are unconditional, the argument cannot be that secession is justified   when   ..... Con however, not believing in a right to secession, can indeed make the arguement that secession is permissible when.....   If my opponent refers to the U.S Revolution, he should be prepared for this clarification to take effect.   Secession and Anarchy   Lincoln stated in 1861 during his inaugural address:  \"   Plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.  \" (1)   As Lincoln explain, secession is rule by the minority. One small faction of a larger sovereign cannot individually decide to claim all sovereignty over itself. My proof exists on observance, for if such a claim were true, what would prevent mere households from becoming nations?   What is secession? In essence, secession is a mere disempowerment of authority. If a right existed to remove something from the rule of an authority at will, then the authority has no authority! Entities would simply declare their independence whenever decisions were not to their liking.   If South Carolina can declare independence from the U.S, then a county can declare its independence from South Carolina,...and then a city can declare its independence, and then individuals can declare independence. What then happens to authority? It has no power. There is no rule, no government, and what is left is the essence of anarchy, anyone can rule themselves at a moments notice.   As an article published in the New York Times (1860) stated:   \"  The ties that bind the States together will first be severed, and respect for law and order correspondingly weakened. Obligations to municipal laws will next be repudiated by a refusal on the part of the people to obey them. Next will follow the obligations between individuals, till neither persons nor property are longer respected, and forms of government become a mockery, because they   can neither command respect nor enforce obedience  .\"   (2)  Perpetual Unity  If we liken the Constitution to somewhat of an interminable contract, a few points arise.   Under the following syllogism, we can prove that there is no right to secession.   1. The Constitution was a document of perpetual unity.  2. The states ratified the Constitution.   3. The states ratified perpetual unity.   THE LOGIC HERE BEING:   ....if a state ratified perpetual unity and submission of sovereignty to both the Constitution and federal government, then it cannot claim such rights later. One who has signed a contract cannot then go against that contract, not in the legal sense, but in the moral sense. It would be unfair to default on that which you agreed to.   The Constitution was a document of perpetual Unity  TAKE NOTE: The plans and concepts of the Articles of Confederation were not relinquished, but rather fixed and expanded in the Constitution \"  TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION  \"(3) ....Therefore, the concepts of a weak federal government were the only things to be revised by the Constitution, every other concept carried over into the Constitution under \" to form a MORE perfect union\" (\"more\" being additive, not reductive).   The full name of the Articles of Confederation is   The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union (4)  . Thus, the Articles called for perpetual unity. If the Constitution was to perfect the perpetual union already set forth by those Articles, then how could it allow or condone secession? It couldn\\'t.   I believe that chief justice Salmon Chase (1869) explains this point far better than I.   \"  By these, the Union was solemnly declared to \"be perpetual.\" And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained \"to form a more perfect Union.\" It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not?  \"(5)  Furthermore, It is explicitly stated in Article 1 Section 10 of the United States Constitution that:  \"  No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation...  \" (6)  Why would the Constitution explicitly prohibit the aforementioned actions? ...because they are all acts of complete sovereignty and individualism. They all submit jurisdiction and sovereignty to powers other than the United States. Secession is the submission of jurisdiction and sovereignty of a state unto itself, which is still a power other than the United States!   Upon the intentional vagueness of the Constitution, the drafters made it a point to specifically outline the prohibition of this concept. Why would submission of sovereignty to a force other than the United States suddenly be made acceptable in the case of secession?   All the 13 original states ratified the Articles of Confederation, from which the declaration of perpetual unity was made obvious,...and they all ratified the Constitution, from which perpetual unity was more nuanced, but present none the less. The States clearly conceded to the idea.   In conclusion, perpetual unity is indeed a part of the Constitution, albeit it is nuanced...(and remember that vagueness, nuance and interpretation was the PURPOSE of the Constitution) Therefore, the Constitution was a document of perpetual unity in nuance and intention, and it was not so discrete that a state could claim ignorance.   The States Ratified the Constitution  There is not a large necessity for elaboration on this particular premise, as it is a statement of fact. (7)   Applying to those states that were admitted into the union:   Upon terroritoral aquisition of the land to which the state resides, acceptance to the Constitution was made immediately and automatically,...as \"the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America. (7) ...and those territories are a part of the United States of America.   Conclusion  Having proved the first two premises of my syllogism, we have arrived at the conclusion that the states ultimately ratified perpetual unity. Referring back to the meaning of this conclusion, even from a moral eye, one cannot default on that which he agreed to. Furthermore, I reiterate on the point that secession is the essence of anarchy, for it removes the power of authority. I rest my argument on this two points for the time being, and await my opponent\\'s response.

', 'Final Rebuttals  Rule by the minority    \"  Any state who wishes to secede is not claiming rule over the athority from which it seceded, but wishing to control themselves.   \"  What my opponent conveniently ignores throughout his entire argument is the sheer fact that the state does not have complete sovereignty over itself. I spent 8,000 characters proving the point (which my opponent glossed over) that the ratification of the constitution was an instant deconstruction of all individual sovereignty to merge into one larger sovereign. If the United States were a mere association of 50 sovereigns, then my opponent\\'s case would hold. However, the United States is a singular sovereign divided into political subgovernments. Secession in this regard would not be a reclamation of individual sovereignty, as such ceased to exist upon the ratification and formation of a singular country, but rather it would be a THEFT OF SOVEREIGNTY from the body which claims it.   \"  By ratifying the Constitution, the people transferred certainlimited sovereign powers to the federal government from their states  \" (1)   Only decisions made by the majority can affect the whole entity. Secession is a decision made by a minority that affects the entire entity, therefore it CANNOT be allowed. A state that leaves the union would have the following effects on the country as a whole:  1. Revenue depletion (tax source cut off)  2. Army capability reduction (citizens cut off in spontaneous mass exodus induced by a government under term \"secession\")   3. Natural homeland resource reduction (land cut off from U.S jurisdiction)   4. Geographical claims of jurisdiction deduction (power, authority and size cut off)   To name a few. Secession is a decision that can only be made by the MAJORITY of the entire entity. The minority cannot hold power to make decisions affecting the entirety. THIS is why secession is rule by the minority. Again, the states ratified the Constitution, and that terminated their individual sovereignty. When a state secedes, it is not reclaiming some lost soveriegnty, because the sovereignty was consensually destroyed. It is, rather imposing and reducing the sovereignty of the larger state to which it belongs. This is what my opponent purports to be moral.   \"   This point by my opponent is a false dichotomy. It is not an either/or situation, the rule of the majority or the minority. What about co-existence? Surely my opponent does not believe that Great Britain is actively ruling over th United States because they choose to retain their sovereignty over themselves?\"     It is indeed rule of the majority or the minority because the states form a whole, not the appearance of a whole. A decision affecting the entirety cannot be made by the minority.   Destruction of Authority  \"  In this point, my opponnt takes his entire argument out of a misrepresentation of what authority actually is. He substitutes authority for tyrrany. For isn\\'t that what one is excercising when they do not permit free choice?  \"  Authority:    \"  The power to enforce laws, exact obedience, command, determine, or judge\" (2)  Tyranny: \"A government in which a single ruler is vested with absolute power\" (3)  My opponent accuses me of mistaking the two terms when it is he who has them confused. Abolition of secession is not an act of absolute power, so how can it be tyranny? Abolition of secession maintains the authority of the federal government, whereas states cannot simply \"RUN AWAY\" when they dislike the decisions of the federal government, much like they attempted prior to the Civil War. How can an authority exact command or obedience if the entities receiving such always have the power to disregard and annul it? Again, the authority has no authority.   The question which went cold dropped was the central idea of secession equating to anarchy. I extend that ignored contention. If states can secede, then counties can secede, then towns can secede, then homes can secede and whenever they do not like the decision of authority, they have the ability to throw it away. Anyone can rule themselves at a moment\\'s notice.   Perpetual Unity  \"  My opponent claims that this is not a legal argument, but a moral argument. This argment is clearly of a legal nature.  \"   This assertion either originates from a misunderstanding of my argument, or a deliberate distortion thereof. The fact that I refer to legal documents does not instantaneously render the argument a legal one. The point in my doing so was to PROVE a consensus on submission of individual sovereignty. Whereas, if the state submitted and destroyed its individual sovereignty to form A LARGER SOVEREIGN, then it cannot claim it back.  If 50 people got together with 50 small pieces of their own personal cloth, and then sewed it all together to form a blanket for a homeless person, one of them cannot just decide to rip out his piece and be on his merry way. He gave up that piece, it no longer belonged to him, it was a part of the completed blanket, and he relinquished ownership of it. Liken each piece of cloth to sovereignty. THAT is just merely one of the numerous logical methods that renders secession unjustified.   \"   P1: In order for contracts to be legally and morally binding, explicit consent must be rendered by those of which it directly concerns.  P2: The U.S. Constitution did not obtain such consent from those of which the contract directly affected.  C1: Secession was not a violation of any morally or legally binding contract.  \"  The ratification of the Constitution in and of itself was the explicit consent because the Constitution was a document in expanse of the perpetual union already set forth by the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. I already explained and elaborated on this. This syllogism contains a primary premise to which has alrewady been addressed, it is therefore not a supported or legitimate negation.   \"  By ratifying the Constitution, the people transferred certainlimited sovereign powers to the federal government from their states  \" (1)  \"  The claim that a contract is binding over an entire geographical area, can only be valid if it respects the property rights of those affected by the contract. This is supported by the very concept of contract and property. I cannot form a contract with Bob to take possesssion of your house. The owner of the house must consent for this transaction to occur. So, it follows that drafting a document, for it to be binding, must have the consent of those it seeks to govern.  \"  PROPERTY =/= SOVEREIGNTY     My opponent claims that a contract over an entire geographical area can only be valid if it respects property rights. However, this is nothing more than a red herring, as property rights are not in question, SOVEREIGNTY is. An area can be privately owned, but still under the jurisdiction of an authority,   FOR THE AUTHORITY MUST HAVE AUTHORITY TO RECOGNIZE THE PROPERTY AS PRIVATE IN THE FIRST PLACE.    Conclusion   Regrettably, Pro\\'s rebuttals came mostly from a misunderstanding of my argument, and he insufficiently addressed my secession - anarchy contention.

That\"s one death in ten seconds. Think about it; when will it be your turn? A good counter-argument is, \"Those 6 million people chose to kill themselves. Let them do it. It is their right.\" This can be countered by the fact that those who choose to put their lives in danger might as well just break the law. The \"smart\" people will just avoid smoking. Also, peer pressure to smoke will not be present anymore, because you can come up with a simple excuse that it\"s against the law. And what about secondhand smoke? Not happening anymore. The people who cause secondhand smoke to unwary pedestrians will easily get caught and sent to jail. The people who sell smoke in the black market will, of course, will show many symptoms, and that will make them be sent to jail as a smoker. You don\"t have to be a surgeon, a detective, or a rocket scientist to figure out some people are smoking and that is against the law. Their hair will smell bad, their teeth will be yellow, they will have some kind of gum disease, and they will probably have lung cancer. If you choose to stay hidden and smoking for the rest of your life, they why not just do it? Who cares if the government loses billions of dollars? Aren\"t you allowing more people to go to work and be alive and pay tax? Even if you have to raise all tax by 1%, it is much better than getting the money from a drug company. Another good argument against this is that people on an addict already will continue to smoke and it is unfair if they have to go through the pain of breaking the addict. There are easy ways to see how long the person has been smoking and that the \"old\" symptoms will have therapy to remove the addict. Even if it is still unfair, well, first, life isn\"t unfair, and second, when you picked up the cigarette, you were risking that smoking would soon be outlawed and that you might get in jail for it. We can warn all the previous smokers to go to the nearest police office to get their addict removed, or get in jail if caught and not by turning themselves in. Besides, smoking is worse than some drugs. If you quit smoking, you will soon be able to control drinking alcohol. Those people who still don\"t follow the rule will get the same penalty, and that is also leading to a better-health world. Plus, smoking also causes excessive pollution, and you can obviously outlaw something that doesn\"t just adversely affect you, right? It\"d be even better if all the tobacco fields were turned into mushroom farms--yes, mushroom farms. ', 'I totally agree, but it is harder to break the law than to do anything at all because your conscience will always be there. Plus, you forgot about secondhand smoking. It kills 600 thousand every year. Pollution is also bad. Just because cars pollute doesn\\'t mean that you can legalize a pollution factor that makes up 33% of the pollution. That is a lot of pollution that can at least lessen.    Your first paragraph stated that people have the right to live in polluted areas. Take an example: because so many people smoke, Hawaii is now polluted with cigarette butts, even the beaches. Now, imagine YOU are planning a trip to Hawaii. You go there, and you see cigarettes everywhere. When you are sleeping that night, you realize that a fire has started because of the people who don\\'t completely put out their cigarettes. You did not choose to live in a polluted Hawaii. You wanted to enjoy a good time in Hawaii and not nearly get killed by the cigarette fire. Now, pretend you have a bad asthma case. When you walk down the street, just as you are about to use your inhaler, a guy that is smoking comes right up to you and blows out the cigarette smoke. You start coughing in a big fit. Why would you risk this? Better that you don\\'t go to Hawaii. But, wait, you really wanted to enjoy your time in Hawaii. Now you can\\'t go there? How is that fair?    Your second paragraph states that although secondhand smoke is bad, it shouldn\\'t affect the decision of the smoker. In a black market, you will only secondhand smoke around people who are willing to breathe in your fumes. Plus, secondhand smoke can\\'t really be avoided.    Paragraph 3 states that there are warnings posted on cigarettes. Heck, people who are addicted will die for the cigarette. Smoking, believe it or not, is so bad it is even worse than some kinds of drugs! If people don\\'t look at drug warnings, they probably won\\'t notice smoking warnings.    (Paragraph 4) Yes, I agree with you, but the point is that it is a growing problem and might reach 10 million someday, maybe 2050 if not curbed. Though it is their wish, the 10% that died from secondhand smoking shouldn\\'t have to die. Soon the 600 thousand dead from secondhand smoke will rise to the millions. That\\'s millions that didn\\'t wish to die.    (Paragraph 5) Smoking IS an immediate threat. 30 people die every day due to smoking. 1 in 5 deaths is also caused by smoking. How is that not dangerous? Tanning salons don\\'t harm other people because they don\\'t harm other people. Same as junk food. They harm other people if the other people want to do the same. Secondhand smoking is not a choice. If you lived with somebody who smokes, maybe you\\'d understand. It is really annoying. The smoke stinks, as well.    (Paragraph 6) Smoking is an addiction. Surely people find smoking a relief if they are addicted. Surely other people don\\'t feel the same way if they are not addicted to smoking. Surely other people don\\'t want them to smoke and get themselves dead because of secondhand smoke. You could say that murdering is a form of pleasure to them. They why do they get the death penalty? The dangerous enjoyment that adversely affects others is definitely not okay.    (Paragraph 7) Surely, prices will rise with so many people buying them, and the sellers will run out of cigarettes fast. Parents will get suspicious of either the black market at school and getting bad grades, or having to be \"somewhere\" twice a day after or before school. They will soon realize what they are doing.    (Paragraph 8) Like I said before, cigarettes can\\'t be made if they are outlawed. If they are secretly made, the excessive smoke coming from there will be tracked down to the black market source, so cigarettes can\\'t be made. Tobacco can\\'t be grown also if it is outlawed, either. People can go to jail if they can\\'t choose to abide by the law of not smoking cigarettes. If you give everybody a chance to give it up, then it is fair that they go to jail. By the way, you can use this method for getting back the money for not getting tax money from cigarettes. The new land from the loss of tobacco can be used for other things too, like growing fruits and vegetables and other healthy things as an alternative to smoking.    (Paragraph 9) Just because alcohol isn\\'t outlawed doesn\\'t mean smoking can\\'t be outlawed either. The only reason why the 18th amendment was repealed was because governments didn\\'t have the right technology to see who was drinking and who was not. We could have outlawed alcohol again if nobody figured out that moderate amounts of red wine are extremely healthy. But there is nothing healthy about smoking.    (Paragraph 10) It is easier to say that something is illegal than to address all the bad points of smoking. The people who smoke will get caught and they will be really sorry. Even though if that doesn\\'t happen, the cons still don\\'t outweigh the pros.    (Paragraph 11) In this case, you should eliminate the pollution of anything that is reasonable. Here, smoking accounts for 1/3 of the pollution, and nothing is good about it anyway. So why wouldn\\'t you do it? We are also starting to have electric cars that produce nearly zero pollution. That way, gas stations can be slowly turned into electric stations. Our world isn\\'t perfect, but we must try to do everything to make it become more perfect. Agriculture can\\'t be immediately solved, but we are making vertical farming possible. We are doing everything in our power to make this world a better place to live. One of the things we can do is to outlaw smoking.    www.cancer.org/aboutus/globalhealth/tobacco-control (that\\'s for the 6 million deaths every year) ', 'I bet that there would be more people doing bad things if it was not against the law. If there was no law against stealing, for example, I bet that all the stores worldwide would have their items disappear in one day. Since it is against the law, the attempts to do it are far less. To break a law, only the very bad people would do it. To do something bad and not break the law, the people who are a little bit bad would do it. By the way, if you look at it this way, it\\'s not even 1% of adults. That\\'s only 30,000 people over 3.5 million square miles of land or 1 person over 100 square miles. If you think about it that way, it is not a lot.    To get rid of pollution, we must do everything in our power to stop it. Before, steam engines produced a lot of pollution. Instead of illegalizing them, we decided to cut their pollution, same as cars. But there is no way to do that to smoking. Nicotine, the addicting drug, is the thing that causes pollution. Remove the nicotine, remove the purpose of smoking. So better to just illegalize it and be done with it forever.    Remember, if smoking isn\\'t banned worldwide, there is still pollution going on. How are you going to trace all those little paper sticks to their owners? How are you going to prevent people from smoking, even in those places that are okay to smoke in? The people on the street really do care that the people that are smoking are putting harmful gasses into the air. By the way, it is pretty much the stuff in a gas chamber. Who would want to inhale that in? Why would you not just make smoking illegal? Even if you can\\'t litter, remember that the people on ships can smoke. The garbage can is only a few feet away, and it is the ocean. Who would realize and trace it to the person, again?    If the government has thought about second-hand smoke, then why isn\\'t it banned in the streets? Why do people still die from secondhand smoke? If you have smoking rooms, then that is still pollution because the ventilation can\\'t remove anything, only put it into a different place. Also, they are expensive and serve as an unnecessary room for only those people who solely rely on paper sticks to provide their happiness. Now, imagine if you are going to get your parents from the smoking room. You walk in and are hit by the stench. That is not what you wanted. You didn\\'t want to get secondhand smoked from walking in the smoking room. It is not a good solution and is much better to just illegalize smoking.    No, it\\'s not that they can ignore the warning, it\\'s that they can\\'t. Like how I said before, they would die for the cigarette. Even though they want to, they can\\'t just quit that easily. 69% of people want to quit smoking completely. However, only a quarter of a percent of people is expected to quit for good. And that\\'s only expected. I bet that there is at least 1% of them that don\\'t quit for good.    We won\\'t criminalize junk food because it is the people\\'s choice to destroy themselves with obesity or not. We are helping cars recognize if they are in danger by adding the \"automatic stop\" function. If they are near another car, then they are going to stop by themselves. Some models are already doing that. It has lessened car crashes by a lot from those brands. Sadly, it is very expensive. But smoking harms others around you. Like putting in light sensors in cars, we are going to do something to smoking, and in this case, that is illegalizing it. Cars are not the problem. 6 million people die from smoking, like how I said in the first argument.    Also like how I said before, secondhand smoking cannot be totally prevented.    Even if there are right now 1 trillion cigarettes, they will soon disappear from the black market after the supply is gone. If you continue making them, the people will notice odd gasses coming from that place, whether it\\'s from a sewer, etc. The money from fines will cover that up.    Why can\\'t they just tax alcohol highly? Money isn\\'t a concern now.    One sentence: Marijuana doesn\\'t produce smoke, smoking does. ', 'forfeit ', 'forfeit '], 'opinions': ['Smoking Is Bad In EVERY Way  Now, I totally agree with you that it is people’s right to smoke, but smoking doesn’t just affect you, but it also affects other people. Secondhand smoke kills 600,000 people every year! Those people, of course, didn’t choose to kill themselves by the smoke of other people. They, well, nearly all of them didn’t go to the smoker and purposely inhale their smoke. If you choose to commit suicide with smoking, why not just break the law? By the way, it’s much easier when someone pressures you to smoke to say that it’s against the law rather, “I don’t think I should.”Yes, smoking might introduce more people on the black market, but if people just smoke in the black market, they can’t secondhand smoke, or the people around them would have reported them to the police. If you litter, obviously, somebody will find out and you’ll have to put them into bags and then burn them up. That will decrease secondhand and thirdhand smoking, and also the litter on the ground.No, there are symptoms of long-term smoking and short-term smoking. The people that used to smoke will get removed of their addiction. That way, if they still are found smoking, then it’s time to go to court. You can just ask all the smokers to come get their smoking addict removed or choose to be a criminal. And what if it’s still unfair? It’s already unfair that other people have to breathe in your fumes. It’s already unfair that you litter all over the place so that others can live on a polluted Earth. You took that risk that it might be made illegal when you walked to the store counter with a cigarette pack and some change, and later put the paper roll in your mouth. That’s pretty much all your fault.Don’t just think about the past. Alcohol is a different situation than smoking. They didn’t have the right material to prove who was drinking and who was not. They saw a better way to do this. Since the only dangerous part about alcohol is drinking and driving, they put up a law against that instead. In my opinion, that was a very smart move because it pretty much rules out the dangerous parts of drinking alcohol. Soon, they even might outlaw drinking over a certain amount. There is enough proof lying in the drinker’s body for that. But to be back on topic, pretty much everything about smoking is dangerous. That’s why we should outlaw smoking. Think about it; the fines of people smoking can easily cover the loss of money from the breakdown of smoking stores. That is easy to cover. Why be afraid to lose money? It is much more sensible to think about things like cancer and disease of smokers. The money is not important and can get covered up anyway? Why worry about the money of smoking?

Their perception (what they see/hear (hallucinations/delusions)) is their reality. The only reason this isn\\'t also OUR reality is because we\\'d disagree that there\\'s a dragon in the microwave, for example, because we simply do not perceive (sense (via sight or sound)) that there\\'s a dragon in the microwave.    So, my opponent is exactly right when he stated that \"perception is highly dependent on a person\\'s opinion.\" Not only is it dependent on a person\\'s opinion, but also his or her mood, personality, childhood, etc. This list goes on and on because it\\'s a list of what a given individuals reality is comprised of. In other words, what we experience (via sensory input) is the only thing we can be certain exists. But even then, we can never actually \"prove\" anything because things can only be so objective. If this doesn\\'t make sense to you consider the following.    A rat gets food every time he turns left in a maze and soon becomes a left-turning rat. This is a lawful observation (conditioning). But would laws like this exist if no one were here to see them? ', 'forfeit ', 'The universe is the mind of God. ', \"Isn't the human brain awe inspiring? A 3 pound blob of jelly that's able to contemplate the vastness of the universe, contemplate infinity, and contemplate itself contemplating infinity. We know that there are roughly the same number of neuron permutations in a human brain as there are elementary particles in the universe. As we exist in the image of the universe, so too does the universe exist in our eyes, as we look up at a night's sky. God is the principle of symmetry and cohesion, which is what holds the universe together. I do not believe in a 'personal God' [the God of prayer]. Rather, I believe in the 'God' that created such a beautiful universe. Perhaps humans are all tiny pieces of God's mind [the universe]. Perhaps now you're wondering: how can you determine WHOSE mind? And the answer to that is a physical and mathematical definition of God. Now, even though such a definition exists, we cannot see everything God sees. Whereas God perceives one total act of creation in a parallel manner, with everything in perfect orientation, we are localized in space (and time), perceiving reality only through a sequence of locally creative moments. Again, don't be blind to the other side of the coin, remember to not only see concrete reality but rather the relationship between mind and reality *mind : concrete :: reality : abstract* \", 'I respect my opponent\\'s acknowledgment. I\\'ve invested a lot of time into my work. I also respect his precocious ability.    The \"evidence\" is as follows. That which is immaterial is abstract, and abstraction is a mental process that \"abstracts\" or educes general relationships from observations. So philosophically, saying that space is immaterial and therefore abstract amounts to saying that it is mental\"...that it is composed of mind rather than matter. By definition, there is nothing outside of reality that is real enough to contain reality. So reality is self-contained. A self-contained medium must provide that which is necessary to its own existence. So, if energy is necessary for the existence of reality, reality must find that energy within itself since we know that matter consists of energy [from Einstein\"s e=mc2]. In other words, the universe, using its own energy, made its own matter. You may be asking how it does that. And the answer is: by configuring itself in such a way that the matter it made would be recognized as such by other matter.    Now let\"s answer my opponent\"s question: \"Why are there so many imperfect forces in nature...What about children born disfigure or mentally handicapped?\" God is the principle of symmetry, and symmetry is defined as two mirror images. Therefore since symmetry exists, its mirror image, asymmetry must also exist.    To entertain my opponent\"s statement that \"all matter will be engulfed by black holes\", let\"s pretend that precognition [predicting the future] doesn\"t violate all the laws of our universe. Mathematically, if this were to happen, white holes would exist on the other side of these black holes\"as mirror images of each other\"because for every reaction, there\"s an equal and opposite reaction. *black hole : white whole :: symmetry : asymmetry*  But unfortunately, as Michio Kaku explains in his book, \"Physics of the Impossible\", precognition is one of only two things that violate the laws of our universe [the other is self-perpetuating motion]. I support my opponent\"s statement, \"\"our definition of perfect comes from our own perception\". However, more importantly, perception is reality. '], 'opinions': [\"A personal 'God of prayer' does not exist.  I believe in the God that created the universe.   The universe didn't have to be as marveling and symmetrical as it is; it could've been messy, it could have been random.   Perhaps the universe is the mind of God.   God is the principle of symmetry and cohesion, which is what holds the universe together.   Perhaps we are tiny pieces of the mind of God. \", \"Perception is reality.
